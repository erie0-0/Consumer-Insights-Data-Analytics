R2QGEC3WRQRMLX,B07PXGQC1Q,5.0 out of 5 stars Very practical,renee,5,"Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's ""universal"" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.AppleCare tips:You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.Using AirPods with Android:Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find ""AirPods"" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.FAIR WARNING:You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called ""AirPopUp"". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT & RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more.For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods.Galaxy Buds features:Made by SamsungAudio powered by AKGRubber ear bud tipsPair with Samsung device to get the mostWireless charging caseActive noise cancellationComes in multiple colors (black/white/silver/yellow/red & black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+)Includes changing cord and replacement rubber earbud tips.I know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled ""Galaxy Wearable"". This allows users to check battery life status of the case and each bud, prompts you for software updates, ability to program LEFT & RIGHT earbuds to do certain function(s), answer/decline/hang up phone calls, pause/skip/reset songs.Apple may charge a lot of money for their products on accessories but they never fall short of being a revolutionary, well-designed, reliable product that works as advertised.","Reviewed in the United States October 19, 2023",AEYO6M357PGA7I2MHHB2FQ5FSDEA,TRUE,224,Set: Without AppleCare+

R2R9VD3N1ZT9MO,B07PXGQC1Q,4.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound and Convenience with Minor Drawbacks,Adam Abdou-Gustavson,4,"I've been using the Apple AirPods 2nd Generation for a few months now, and overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase. These earbuds offer a lot of convenience and solid performance.Pros:Sound Quality: The audio quality is excellent, with clear highs and balanced mids. They‚Äôre great for listening to music, podcasts, and making phone calls.Seamless Connectivity: Pairing the AirPods with my iPhone and other Apple devices is incredibly smooth. The instant connection and switching between devices are standout features.Comfort and Fit: They fit comfortably in my ears and stay in place during workouts.

While they do a decent job of passive noise isolation, it‚Äôs not enough in noisy environments.Price: They‚Äôre a bit on the expensive side, especially considering the lack of noise cancellation. There are other earbuds with similar or better features at a lower price point.Fit May Vary: While they fit my ears well, I‚Äôve heard from friends that they don‚Äôt fit everyone perfectly. It‚Äôs worth trying them on before committing to a purchase.In summary, the Apple AirPods 2nd Generation offer great sound quality, convenience, and battery life, making them a solid choice for anyone in the Apple ecosystem. While they lack some advanced features like noise cancellation, they still provide a fantastic listening experience and seamless integration with Apple devices.","Reviewed in the United States May 31, 2024",AH7LXZF3MXW5WLMCOOZJXPKU6NBQ,TRUE,39,Set: Without AppleCare+

I use them to listen to my computer while I play music on my stereo in the background. I also don't feel them in my ear which is super nice. Over the ear headphones get too warm and uncomfortable, and in ear earbuds block out sound and get uncomfortable over extended use, so these are perfect. These also stay connected compared to my first ten AirPods which would constantly drop the connection. My only gripe is when I attempt to stream Spotify on my iPhone to my home stereo the AirPods will take over and connect if I am wearing them while using them for the computer, so I have to go back into Spotify on my phone and reconnect it to the stereo. Not the end of the world, but I wish there was a way to prevent that from happening.

R1HA6GWOISYTFN,B07PXGQC1Q,4.0 out of 5 stars Purchased these in Nov 2019 & still going strong,Melanie Hawthorne,4,"I bought my 2nd gen Airpods back in 2019 and never expected for them to last this long. (In fact, I was a skeptic when Apple first announced how these things would stay in your ears.) Sounds quality hasn't diminished over time. It picks up ambient sound pretty well, sometimes making it hard for the caller to hear you. Sometimes it has a muted sound and the caller will say you sound muffled. So it's not perfect as a mic device but functions well enough most of the time that it's not a problem. Audio quality to me is great. Never have an issue with sound, music, or hearing a caller. They're not really noise-canceling, so if you're looking for that, you'll be disappointed. However, I've found that if I up the volume, it will drown out loud sounds. I don't like my volume extremely loud since I like to be able to hear what's going on around me, but for trains or large trucks rumbling by, the volume is excellent and still retains good quality. (Not that distortion sound that comes with playing music too loud.)Overall, I'd recommend. I've had this for nearly 5 years (bought it for myself as a Black Friday gift!), and I don't regret it. I see no need to upgrade to a Pro. Audiophiles may want surround sound type thing, in which I'd recommend a Pro, but 2nd gen works well enough for me (until prices drop for some of the newer ones).","Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2024",AGLIW2ME2UMV6MELUQXKQEP6CDLA,TRUE,16,Set: Without AppleCare+

People have said the call quality is excellent, and even the battery life of the buds and case (which are different) show up in IOS for a quick reading. Apparently the case gets charged, and the buds charge from the case making it an independent power source for them. Very clever.

Pairs perfectly, just as most Apple products do. You can program them to do various things when you tap them, so you don't have to do everything through the phone. The voice recognition is very handy when driving and you need Siri to do something for you. The mic is a little quiet on phone calls, so I cup my hand to my mouth to direct sound to them when needed.After a while though, my left ear is sore from the shape of the earbud. It's probably just my ear shape. Still not interested in paying more for the smaller, more cushy ones. Hundreds of dollars is ridiculous.I recommend getting the little silicone case cover, as it helps you find the item, clip it to your phone, etc. Keep them clean, don't get them wet, don't store them in pockets and lose them. They seem to survive small drops. They do have a feature that makes noise to help you find them, but only if they still have some charge in their batteries.","Reviewed in the United States June 22, 2024",AFZAUG5S6T5FHORGNTMQHNLQ6HZQ,TRUE,1,Set: Without AppleCare+

All of the styles I had to return got far greater reviews for sound quality, and they all allow you to see the amount of battery charge left on the case.These earbuds have so-so sound quality, and I never use them for phone calls. So I can‚Äôt speak about that aspect. The choices of what you can tap on either the left or right side for are limited. Other ear phones or buds have multiple ways you can touch your right and left sides, to get sound levels, on/off, next track, answering phone, etc. The main thing these do is allow you to use Siri, as they are an Apple product, albeit several models ‚Äúold.‚Äù The main drawback to these is that you cannot look at the case to see how much battery charge is left. You must open the case up when your Bluetooth area is open within your phone‚Äôs or iPads‚Äô setting, in order for that to tell you the battery percentage for both the ear buds and the case which can charge them.

RUUJJA0TERA67,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Compared to 4 other Earbuds...,Connor,5,"I bought these earbuds along with 4 other pairs, with the intent of comparing them over a couple weeks and returning all but my favorite. Here were the results:Beats Fit Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JL65GNM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì These buds had some great base, and the wingtip gave them a fit that made them refuse to fall out of my ears. But the best feature? Physical ‚Äúclicky‚Äù buttons on each one of the buds. You press in and hear/feel the click, rather than relying on a touchscreen-like feature. No need to guess if you tapped them once or twice, you will know.Cons ‚Äì The wingtip gives a very sturdy fit, but not the most comfortable. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend to anyone with smaller ears. The noise canceling was solid, but nothing special. And this may be picky, but I didn‚Äôt care for most of the color schemes available. I prefer my earbuds to be hard to notice, and even the black ones have a bright red letter ‚Äúb‚Äù in the middle.Beats Studio Buds - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì Very comfortable with the same great physically ‚Äúclicky‚Äù buttons as the Beats Fit Pro. Noise canceling seemed slightly better than average. Great base. Classic look.Cons ‚Äì Tested during a workout, a little bit of sweat had these sliding right out of my ear. The case for these earbuds also was the flimsiest of any I had tested, with a very weak hinge that I was scared of breaking off within the 2 weeks of using.Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì A neat feature that I noticed only in these earbuds was that it had noise amplification as well as noise cancelation. With one swipe in the app, the surrounding sound was actually louder and clearer than it would be without the earbuds in. Great if you are hard of hearing, or just enjoy snooping on conversations out of reach.Cons ‚Äì Similar to the Beats Studio Buds, these didn‚Äôt stay in during a workout. They were usable, but every 10 minutes I found myself pushing them back into my ear. And this is an opinion, but these are the ugliest earbuds out of the bunch. The shiny black gleam made it look like a large beetle was hanging out in my ear. No visible brand placement either, which makes them appear cheap and generic rather than the quality Samsung they are.Samsung Galaxy Buds Live - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TBM1L3S?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì Cost effective! I added these to the test group because of the unique shape, and for that they are worth giving a try. If you have small ears and do not like the rubber insert that is standard in most other earbuds, these may be perfect for you.Cons ‚Äì Poor fit for large ears. These were tested the least of all of the buds, because the fit was so bad for my ear shape that they wouldn‚Äôt stay in if I turned my head too fast.Bose QuietComfort - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4KWM9T?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì Bose noise canceling is unmatched. If your primary use for earbuds is to cancel out that background white noise, this is the pair for you. The sound quality is great, not too heavy on the base. The case for the earbuds stood out from the rest as the only one that impressed me. Felt very study, and I had no worries tossing it into a gym bag or cup holder. The only case with a button latch to make sure it doesn‚Äôt open accidentally.Cons ‚Äì This was the most expensive pair of earbuds by a longshot, and there were still some things I felt could be improved. The rubber inserts had more of a ‚Äúflayed‚Äù shape rather than the ‚Äúrounded‚Äù shape that is standard. My guess is that this was by design, because the earbuds were also slightly heavier than others and may need that extra in-ear grip. The flayed shape did make them sturdier, but at the cost of them being uncomfortable in an active situation. They were also the largest earbuds, and stuck out from the side of my head further than I would have liked.My favorite? The beats fit pro!

R3EO2GBST2UICI,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Initial review and comparison to other brands,philip seitz,5,"I love these earbuds. They feel definitely worth the price and a all around great buy. Giving me exactly what I was looking for.For years I have used the raycon E55 and some of the features I loved about raycon was the manual button in the earbuds, excessive bass and great inside-ear fit.Recently however, raycon has gone the way of the world‚Äî they have put sensors on the earbuds in the place of buttons and Balanced out the audio. So I began my search for new earbuds.‚ÄîTHE SOUND‚ÄîBoth the AirPods, galaxybuds and raycons I have tried tend to be balanced and prioritize giving equal notes to all instruments For a clear and concise sound, But to someone who is not an audiophile it sounds very flat and devoid of the punch that I desire. For me- I want it to be great sounding but also noticeably bass heavy. These Beats Studio buds deliver. The company recognizes that your not using these to analyze a song. These are for the people who like bass and want to feel some gravitas in their ears!‚ÄîCONNECTIVITY‚ÄîThese connect effortlessly to iPhone, as if they were AirPods. It was the single biggest factor that blew me away with these. They are incredibly easy to connect. I cannot speak for android but these work great. They do not have a lot of audio adjustments like Bose but I frankly don‚Äôt need them to. You can easily see the battery state on both buds and the case from a pop up window in your apple home screen whenever opening the case, just like AirPods.‚ÄîFIT‚ÄîThe fit is not as good as the raycon E55 but only by a little bit. They fit snuggly in your ears well enough that they do not fall off when running and working out. Although adjustments might need to be made to them occasionally. (I have small ears, so the fit is review as such)‚ÄîTHE CONTROLS‚ÄîThe controls are simple and straightforward. They are just like what you come to expect from earbuds. Single tap, double tap, triple tap.The earbuds HAVE AN ACTUAL BUTTON‚Ä¶ which I thought was extinct, I personally hate the sensor buttons because adjusting your earbuds in your ears would trigger the controls.While these do have a very sensitive physical button‚Äî it is easy to avoid while adjusting with practice.‚ÄîBATTERY‚ÄîThe battery lasts me all day, what more do you want?‚ÄîRANGE‚ÄîVery good, about 30+ feet‚ÄîCONS‚Äî-no MagSafe compatible charging-fit isn‚Äôt as perfect as some brands but is really good-if your an audiophile these earbuds are not balancedFinal call-If you like bass, and hate the sensor controls on most earbuds‚Äî these very well could be the best earbuds you could get. These are on par with earbuds in the 200$ range. And if your anything like me, you will love them! And if not, they might still be worth it to you‚ÄîUPDATE‚Äîthey have a hard time staying in when working out, and so I had to buy wing tips for these. They automatically have active noise cancellation on when you take them out of the case‚Ä¶ which I personally hate.And the cases battery is pretty short lived‚Ä¶ only lasts two days generally","Reviewed in the United States September 28, 2023",AFMDCDCHBIWSEI6RDYBCY4MXXVZQ,TRUE,563,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

R29LYUZ7DI2CS6,B096SV8SJG,"4.0 out of 5 stars Quality sound and build, BUT...",Everest,4,"After using these for a couple weeks straight, I think it's time to review.I would like to state upfront that I bought these on sale for $75. I bought the black ones because the pink ones weren't on sale.Let's start with some pros:The sound is very good, just about on par with my IEMs. These are definitely catered towards more bassy genres, but in the case of metal, I like being able to hear bass along side lead, and provides some heavy kicks. The physical button instead of just touch is an odd choice, but it works. The package comes with a free trial of Apple music (which I will never use), as well as a tiny usb-c to usb-c charger (so hopefully you have a spare usb-c block), and 3 different sized tips, small, meduim, and large. These have awareness mode, as well as a noise isolation mode. Awareness mode is nice, but noise isolation causes me to have a headache.Now some cons:This may be just my ears, but the small tip is too small, and the medium is just big enough to still be pushed out. The body is very smooth, and if you're someone that produces a lot of earwax (like me), it won't stay put and the only thing keeping it in is the tips, meaning you have to keep pushing them back in, and bumping the button. These sit in a very specific position, but don't really like to stay there. Because of the sound mostly being catered towards bass, some leads and vocals can sound a bit muddy at times. By default, the case doesn't have a loop for a string to hold on to and the case is very smooth, so you have to buy a third party case and put it over the stock case just to make it easier to hold on to. These come with an app, and it's very lackluster. No equalizer, there's a find earbuds feature but I'm pretty sure it's not GPS, and you can't mess with settings if the earbuds aren't connected, not to mention: why do my earbuds need to update?!In conclusion: these are good earbuds and I recommend them, but ONLY IF THEY'RE ON SALE.These are 100% worth the $75 I spent on them, but NO WAY ARE THEY WORTH THE $150 RETAIL PRICE TAG.","Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2024",AEDBORE5CT34E6D7QVXFZW5ZERCA,TRUE,5,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

R3OTWPP01KM2BY,B096SV8SJG,3.0 out of 5 stars actually disappointing,kimmy,3,"bought these after my airpod pros died on me suddenly. i have been using these beats studio buds for about 6 months and the experience has been inconsistent to say the least. first issue: they fall out of my ears if i do simple things like turn my head or chew. i can barely walk or exercise with them in because they just fall out. i looked online and it seems others have had these issues; people were suggesting swapping the size of the actual ear bud and even wearing them in reverse (with the left bud in the right ear and right bud in left ear). neither if these worked for me. really made me appreciate the airpod design.it was fairly easy to connect the very first time but every time after that is almost always a pain. if the case is dead but the beats themselves are still charged it‚Äôs like it doesn't recognize that the beats are still working and refuses to connect. even if the case is charged sometimes it just will not recognize that the beats are in range of my phone, even if they're sitting right on top of each other. if it‚Äôs not straight up refusing to connect it‚Äôs disconnecting randomly. if i open my car door - even with the car turned off - the beats automatically disconnect from my phone as if it expects me to connect my phone to carplay. there are many times i have been talking on the phone using my beats and suddenly they will disconnect.the controls only kind of work. you can use the default preset controls like pressing twice for skipping songs and once for hanging up calls and the like. however you're supposed to be able to customize these controls to in your phone settings but they only work as long as the beats are disconnected. as soon as you put the beats away and disconnect everything goes back to default settings the next time you reconnect. noise cancellation is a joke, it sounds the same as when its on transparent mode or off.the case feels like cheap plastic. i got a silicone case because i was afraid of scratching it up. not much else to say about it.the color of the beats are great. i got red and it looks super cool. i think the sound quality is on par with my old airpod pros. when i am on the phone others have not had a problem with not hearing me or me coming across muffled, so that‚Äôs a plus.overall, these earbuds are nothing special. i got these around the holidays when they were almost half off. glad i didn‚Äôt pay full price for these as they are disappointing at best.ETA: as of july 2024 i ditched these and bought another pair of airpod pros. literally no regrets.","Reviewed in the United States May 25, 2024",AFSUYJ3N2JAFCBPFF7G6VM5LLT5A,TRUE,70,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

R3W44HXR3GUPIE,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Makes sense for price.,Bee,4,"I am not a sound junkie, so take my review as someone who knows nothing about specs, quality, etc.Performance wise, they do what I expect them to do. They play my music. The buds do not have ear detection, so you have to press play/pause anytime something interrupts you. The sound was also very low when I received them, as they were a used product, but a little configuration in my settings fixed that immediately. I had no issues pairing them. I do like that you can see battery level without opening the case, you just go to your bluetooth icon and it‚Äôs there for both buds plus case.They‚Äôre not great at noise cancelling if I had to compare to say, AirPod pros. They‚Äôre more noise reducing, so if that‚Äôs your driving point with these you will not get what you are looking for. They do utilize spatial audio too, but again it‚Äôs just enough to say it‚Äôs there.Comfort wise, I like how they fit in my ear. Downside if I am working out they will fall out if I start sweating. They have squishy tips though which I do enjoy.Putting them in the case can be confusing. If you drop the case they will fly out though. Upside to that, these bad boys have survived my washer and dryer three times so far with no hit to the existing quality of sound or performance.Appearance wise they are really small, if you have long hair you could easily hide these during whatever you are doing.I got the black color, pretty standard. Nothing too different than what‚Äôs pictured.They‚Äôre extremely lightweight too (reference back to dropping the case) so I do suggest a protective case if you need some weight to it.

R2FJ02IAUY08JQ,B096SV8SJG,3.0 out of 5 stars Not Worth the Hype: Disappointing Features Despite Good Sound Quality,KFCC,3,"**Review:**I really wanted to like these, but after using them for almost a week, I find them poor in everything except for the relatively good sound when playing music. They are absolutely unusable for my work, which involves video conferencing. This is a deal-breaker.**Pros:**- Sound Quality: The mids are nice and clear, and the bass is tight and punchy when the volume is turned up. When listening to the right kind of music at high volumes, they can sound downright amazing. I appreciate the trueness of the sound, especially given my diverse music tastes from reggae to hip hop, jazz, R&B, and EDM.- Fit: They sit very snug in my ears, effectively blocking out external sounds, which provides a passive noise-canceling effect.**Cons:**- Noise Cancelling and Transparency Modes: Both modes fall short of expectations. Transparency mode, which should let you hear your surroundings, instead adds a hollow reverb and doesn't work well; I couldn‚Äôt even hear someone talking directly to me while using it. Noise cancellation mode introduces a persistent noise layer, similar to wind or the sea, rather than effectively blocking external sounds.- Controls: The physical buttons are a matter of personal preference. For me, they are frustrating and cumbersome, often leading to accidental pausing of the music, restarting the track, or skipping to the previous track. I find touch-sensitive controls more intuitive. Maybe I'll get used to it over time, but currently, it‚Äôs quite inconvenient.- Bluetooth Range: Disappointingly low with frequent disconnections even at moderate distances. To be honest, they perform similarly to the Earfun Air Pro 3, but I expected them to be better. Maybe I need to cut them some slack since they're a year older (2021) than the Earfun Air Pro 3.- Microphone Quality: Sounds horrible and robotic on a PC, making it unusable for video conferencing or recordings. I need to test the call quality on mobile.**Conclusion:**Overall, I'm not convinced these earbuds live up to the hype or their price. Despite impressive sound quality and numerous positive reviews, I want to be objective and make an informed decision. Here are the questions I‚Äôm considering:- Am I being more critical because of the price?- Is the fact that the normal mode sounds amazing with the passive noise-canceling from the fit enough to overlook the underwhelming or broken modes?- Should I use these earbuds just for music and avoid using them for work, which heavily relies on video conferencing on PC?- Will the microphone performance be better on mobile?- Will the fit remain as good when working out or sweating?- What will happen if they fall into a puddle of water?- Can they handle 8 hours of continuous work without causing fatigue?I realize that I can‚Äôt fully trust online reviews, particularly with notable brands where reviewers might be enamoured by the brand itself or the product‚Äôs popularity. This can lead to mismatched expectations between what is advertised and what actually meets my needs. I‚Äôll continue to test these earbuds in various scenarios to make a more informed decision.","Reviewed in the United States July 24, 2024",AEMRF56YHKNWCKBIVLXZTGEV753A,TRUE,0,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+
R3QIOBHH01818S,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Ok but not excellent for Beats,Amy L.,4,"I bought these renewed so keep that in mind before reading further. Aesthetically, he quality of the product is good, arrived clean, in the original box with charger and manuals. I like the design of the case (small enough to tuck away but big enough to keep track of.) 10/10. The headphones performance though are just ok and that's coming from a long time Beats fan. I bought these specifically because I lost one of my Beats Fit Pro pods (special edition ones that I can't get replaced or don't want to pay 2/3 the cost to do), anyway, these were an affordable backup. Sadly, these particular beats are lacking in sound quality, battery life, and noise cancellation.-Sound quality: 6.5/10 overall for sound with music. The sounds is quite low, volume on the device playing needs to be almost at max to hear comfortably for phone calls or audio/podcasts. Expected more oomph like my other sets.- Battery Life: 6/10. I charged them fully the first night and used them for a 1hr workout and for a few hours of a work shift. The case and headphones were completely dead the next morning without charge. So only one full day of use on a charge which again is starkly different from my Beats Fit Pros that lasted for up to 5-7 days without needing another charge. Boo.Noise Cancellation: 4/10 Probably the most obvious and my least favorite feature of these headphones is the noise cancellation. Even with one headphone in, you can hear absolutely nothing in the surroundings. I know some would love this, but other Beats models have the ambient sound option that allows you to hear the headphone audio AND the surrounding area comfortable. I feel like I'm wearing a hearing aid with these.One perk: Unlike other beats these headphones are interchangeable (at least for me). I was able to swap ears which is nice.Overall Rating: 7/10-Not great, but not terrible.

These Beats Studio Buds were available at another retailer, but not in this red color. I was excited to be able to purchase this red for the same price here at Amazon. Sometimes my little fingers have difficulty pulling the ear bud out of its case, but that may be because of these arthritic fingers. I also question if the battery life is as long as stated. I love the fact that I can connect to music with the press of a button. However, that same button is so sensitive that sometimes I end up disconnecting a caller.

Not GREAT, but not bad.",Papa Boots,4,"Whenever I see something with a 4-star review, it usually means it‚Äôs a solid product but there‚Äôs something (or somethings) keeping it out of 5-star range.For me, these are a perfect example of that. They‚Äôre small (good), not terribly obtrusive (only some out-of-ear-stick-out, tho your experience may vary), the sound has some solid bass which is helpful for the gym (where I tested these out), the sound overall is clear (download some equalizer apps to play with the sound itself), and they stayed in my ear well. I don‚Äôt know much about soundstage or whatever, but the sound itself is clear, bass is nice and strong, and you can hear even the subtle nuances like the shifting of a hand on guitar strings clearly enough without being disturbed. That, to me, is the sign of a good earbud.The transparency mode and noise canceling modes were alright. But that‚Äôs just it, they‚Äôre alright. Granted, the AirPod Pros have a higher price tag, so they do the ANC and Transparency mode much better. So it‚Äôs understandable that these would do the same, but on just the slightest bit of a lower level.I‚Äôm also spoiled bc the Airpod Pros have wireless charging. These DO have USB C, but the lack of wireless charging is a small thing, really. There‚Äôs something about being able to toss these on a charging pad and leaving them there to charge that‚Äôs just so satisfying. Also, was not a fan of how the case just doesn‚Äôt have that ‚Äúpremium‚Äù feel. The matte finish is nice, tho I would have liked a little more weight in the case lid, but at this point, these are such little (and I mean LITTLE) things that really, it‚Äôs not a dealbreaker.My only thing is the amount they stick out. I‚Äôm sorry, but they do look a little‚Ä¶funny, the way they sort of stick out just a bit so that the ‚Äúb‚Äù logo is upright. They don‚Äôt stick out a LOT, but juuuuust enough that when you look in the mirror, you‚Äôll see a vertical line where the physical button (which I have managed to press on accident a couple of times while adjusting the bud) sticks out. Also, I had a little difficulty getting them to stay in, but that‚Äôs beyond pretty much anyone‚Äôs control.These get that 4th star because of just how they are a solid enough product worth the purchase. They don‚Äôt do any one thing particularly well, but there are just enough teeny things for me that I wouldn‚Äôt say these are the best I‚Äôve ever used. (For comparison, the Jabra 75t gets the equivalent of a 4.3 rating‚Ä¶the hear-through is amazing and their app really helps boost functionality).For me, these are SOLID gym earbuds. They play music loudly, clearly enough, and the bass is strong enough for me that I can drown out whatever annoying other music is playing outside. They fit and stay relatively well. For the price tag, you get some good bang for the buck. You could do worse, but at this range, depending on if you want to pitch in a few more, you could also do better.","Reviewed in the United States June 27, 2021",AECTDFXXCI5RLPDMMXH2ELH4LJVA,TRUE,1697,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

Transparency mode is supposed to make it easier to recognize sounds and voices so that you know when to unplug and listen, but it rarely works out that way with these.Score down on the battery life for the fact that the Transparency mode uses more battery but doesn't work well.That said the ANC works well and the audio quality for music (including Dolby Atmos), phone calls, and spoken word/podcast is superb.

The Studio Buds deliver rich, balanced audio with deep bass and clear highs, making them perfect for music, podcasts, and calls. The active noise cancellation feature effectively reduces ambient noise, allowing for an immersive listening experience wherever you are.The earbuds are lightweight and comfortable, designed for extended wear. They come with multiple ear tip options to ensure a secure fit, enhancing noise isolation and comfort even during vigorous activities.I appreciate the IPX4 rating, which makes the earbuds sweat and water-resistant. This feature is ideal for workouts or outdoor use, providing peace of mind against moisture damage.The built-in microphone offers clear voice quality during calls, ensuring excellent communication without background noise interference.Bluetooth connectivity is seamless, thanks to the Class 1 technology, providing a stable connection and extended range for reliable performance.Overall, the Beats Studio Buds are a top-notch choice for anyone seeking high-quality true wireless earbuds with noise cancellation, sweat resistance, and broad compatibility. They combine superior sound with comfort and durability, making them a valuable investment for both music enthusiasts and professionals alike.","Reviewed in the United States June 29, 2024",AHM7ESHVZOTYFVQJFKL6LYJSCKKA,TRUE,5,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

The volume can still be controlled using the buttons on the buds so I'm just really confused about play/pause not working and since I got these for work I need to be able to easily and quickly pause my audio if a client comes in.

When I first got them they would last all day without needing a charge but now I can barely get to lunch before needing to charge. That‚Äôs the only disappointing part is that battery life doesn‚Äôt last long over time of ownership. Great for listening to music all day long. I can‚Äôt hear when people come up to my desk.

Here's my review after a week of usage. This Beats ear buds has :> Amazing sound quality (I'm not a music professional; so not sure about the little nuances).> Noise cancellation is really good. I could listen to my stuff, while my family watches TV in the same room. Even with the bud in one ear, the sound filtering and clarity are a lot better than what I expected.> You also get an option to turn on and off the noise cancellation. With the noise cancellation off (i.e., transparency) you can hear outside sounds clearer (not as clear as without the ear buds though).> There are options in the bluetooth settings page (iOS) where the ""press & hold"" function of the ear buds stem can be toggled between ""noise control / Siri"" and turn on ""volume control"".> Battery life is very impressive. For my use case to listen to podcast and music, it lasts for several hours (atleast so far).> When the buds are put in the case, it magnetically latches in the right position.> It fits perfectly in the ear. It has the soft eartips that works better than an airpod pro for me.> It has the ""Find My"" option to locate if misplaced.Just a couple of features that i wish were better if addressed:> Auto audio turn off when the buds are taken off of the ear / falls off the ear. The audio continues in these cases. I.e., if you're listening to a podcast, wants to take it off for a few min and keeps it in your pocket, it can very well turn on accidentally (because it needs only a soft click to turn on) and the podcast would be over by the time you put it back on üòÜ.> No auto-pairing which is a bit annoying. It automatically connects to the last device it was connected. Each time you need to switch to a new device, the connection has to be established manually.> The three clicks for rewind does not usually take in properly, unless you manage to do the three clicks quite fast. If there is a millisecond delay between the presses, it considers it as a single click which is a command to stop.> If you're connecting to the laptop (Mac), the option to use ""noise control / siri"" Vs ""volume control"" seems to be either-or i.e., you may not have both at the same time.","Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2023",AHWVZ7UB4TNBZUSSELY6RB7RRCUA,TRUE,20,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

R7D3A3PPZYWTD,B096SV8SJG,3.0 out of 5 stars Battery lasts awhile but almost no BASS,John Brandt,3,"Very disappointed with these. Not only does the volume not go up loud enough but there is no bass. With my bose in ear headphones they had bass and almost enough volume. I went with these because my bose did not have the battery longevity that I needed. Also the beats don't feel secure in the ear. The bose are heavier but are definitely secure. The audio quality isn't as good as the bose as I felt immersed in the sound like it was coming from all around. I would not buy again nor recommend these for anyone who is an audio enthusiast. I even watched a few reviews and read a few articles about these that stated they were pretty good. Maybe something changed from the time those were written or recorded to this set. Here is what I want, an adjustable set of headphones that don't dial the volume down, have adjustable settings for each frequency range (user set), killer bass, killer highs and mids, last for 4 hours at full volume and don't cost 800 bucks. Is 150 range too much to ask?","Reviewed in the United States July 28, 2024",AET72FSGDTS6GQZHYTRYEST73USQ,TRUE,1,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+
RNDGVPHO1V4I5,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Beats Studio Buds - A Symphony of Style and Sound,dwayne taylor,4,"I recently purchased the Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds, and after spending some quality time with them, I am thoroughly impressed. These earbuds are a fantastic blend of style, functionality, and sound quality, making them a strong contender in the crowded market of wireless earbuds.Design and Comfort:The first thing that struck me about the Beats Studio Buds was their sleek and minimalist design. Available in a range of colors, they have a modern look that stands out without being too flashy. The earbuds are incredibly lightweight and come with three sizes of ear tips, ensuring a comfortable and secure fit. I wore them for hours without any discomfort, which is a big plus for anyone who uses earbuds extensively throughout the day.Sound Quality:Beats has always been known for its emphasis on bass, and the Studio Buds do not disappoint in this regard. The sound is rich and immersive, with a well-balanced profile that doesn't overly skew towards bass. The mids and highs are crisp and clear, making these earbuds suitable for a wide range of music genres. Whether I was listening to classical, rock, or hip-hop, the audio quality remained consistently impressive.Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode:The active noise cancellation (ANC) on the Beats Studio Buds is a standout feature. It effectively blocks out ambient noise, allowing for an immersive listening experience even in noisy environments. The transparency mode is equally impressive, letting in just enough sound to keep you aware of your surroundings without diluting the audio quality of what you're listening to.Battery Life and Connectivity:The battery life of the Beats Studio Buds is solid, offering about 8 hours of listening time and more with the charging case. The earbuds also support fast charging, which is a lifesaver when you need a quick boost. Connectivity-wise, they pair seamlessly with both iOS and Android devices, and the connection remains stable even at a distance.Controls and Functionality:The touch controls are intuitive and responsive, allowing for easy management of playback, calls, and ANC modes. I found the controls to be quite user-friendly, with minimal accidental touches.Conclusion:Overall, the Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds are an excellent choice for anyone looking for high-quality sound, effective noise cancellation, and stylish design in their earbuds. They strike a perfect balance between performance and aesthetics, making them suitable for both casual listeners and audiophiles alike. While they may be a bit pricey, the quality you get justifies the investment. Highly recommended for anyone in the market for a premium wireless earbud experience.","Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2023",AGIAJSPIKY6ECFRXNA6BPVLSNG3A,TRUE,11,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+
RGTK8PYYGJ2FG,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars The Best Bass I've Heard from Earbuds,Matthew hoffacker,5,"These earbuds pack an incredible punch, I rated the noise canceling a 4 because i notice a slight decrease in audio quality whilst on since the drivers are dedicating some of their power to canceling out whatever noise is playing.The Unboxing Experience: Apple does Apple really well. All of their products have an amazing unboxing experience curated for them. These lil guys are no exception, I even noticed the piece the earphones are attached to is like a inch thick piece of cardboard that feels more akin to metal than cardboard.THEY HAVE BUTTONS: Yes all of the major earbuds have controls on the units themselves but none that I've used have implemented buttons so well. These buds have a physical clicky button on each earbud that clicks with just enough pressure to negate accidental touches but not so much pressure that your shoving an earbud driver down your ear canal. Another instance of these buds implementing what others have better.From an Android user: These pair exactly like any galaxy buds would and or apple products to an iphone. You open the case and if you have bluetooth on it has a cool little animation of your product on the phone and its a one click pairing system. Incredibly easy.Connecting to a laptop: Your case must have a charge or be plugged in for these to pair to a laptop. Theres a button in between the buds that if held for 3 seconds sends the buds into a pairing mode where they function much like any other bluetooth product on the market.BASS: YES IT DOES.Price: I got these whilst they were on lightning deal for 79.99 and at that price they are unbeatable. I've come from multiple pairs of bluetooth earbud solutions such as Quiet comfort buds from bose, samsung galaxy buds orginial and pro and pro 2, and Ive even tried both airpod pros and standard airpods. With having tried all of these I see benefits to having one pair over the other but with that price being a major standout reason these buds are now my favorite option for wireless earbuds.OVERALL: These things are freaking sweet and if you can find them on sale you should most definitely be considering them as your next daily driver. Battery, Bass, android compatability, style points for someone who grew up in the early 2000s (used to love those big over ears hanging around my neck i thought i was so cool) and although i didn't focus much on their noise canceling in my review they do that well enough to switch on as needed. If you're trying to enjoy the sound quality of a song as much as possible i would just suggest getting ear tips that fit well and seal. Even with NC turned off these things seal so well I can barely hear my own thoughts - rather just bass rattling - just the way i like it.9.5/10 Really not much you could do better with them.","Reviewed in the United States December 31, 2023",AE6EQLGONN4MPXYFETOA3GDK7WBA,TRUE,40,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

R2J7QWXMNJ99A7,B096SV8SJG,"3.0 out of 5 stars Slippery design, battery and other issues!",Amazon Customer,3,"These Beats earbuds offer decent sound quality, but audiophiles should temper their expectations. While aesthetically appealing, the slippery plastic on both the earbuds and the charging case creates significant usability issues. Removing the earbuds is a slippery frustrating task, and their slick surface makes it difficult to precisely position them for charging. The magnetic charging wells are helpful, but the earbuds often slip and slide between fingers before finding their proper place. A more textured, grippy material would have been a welcome improvement. A slight irritating ticking noise occurs when the earbuds are idle, though thankfully masked by music. Battery life is a major disappointment, falling far short of advertised claims with a mere 3-3.5 hours of use before reaching a critical 15% charge. The noise cancellation is barely noticeable, with only a very subtle audio cue to indicate its activation, which can almost be missed. Additionally, the physical button on the earbuds feels prone to wear and tear and its audible click is distracting and uncomfortable in the ear canal. Overall, I'm underwhelmed by these earbuds and question whether I received a defective pair.","Reviewed in the United States August 1, 2024",AGNI36H7MMREKIH6HPQHV2CGG7BA,TRUE,0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

I was struggling with wired earbuds and a new iPhone 15, which meant having to use an adapter, and I was frustrated by the ones I tried. I thought I would lose mobile earbuds but it's been a month, so far so good.For my primary use, listening to audiobooks, these work great. The sound quality is fine. I've listened to music‚Äîalso fine.It comes with a few alternate earbud sizes, but none has been a perfect fit. One side or the other falls out when I lean over, so I have to make sure they're in good. When one falls out, I don't know why, but it's almost impossible to find, even though they're red. I've used FindMy a few times. I have to move the base and the other earbud into another room as far away as possible, and under a pillow, or I can't differentiate the FindMy beeps. But FindMy works great!Last week, while washing dishes, my left earbud popped out‚Äîinto a bowl of water! I scooped it out immediately, dried it off, and planned to put it in a baggy with silica packets. I was sure I'd killed it. But I am not very patient. I popped it back in after a minute. It worked great!!They have an okay run time but I am often surprised when I hear the signal that means the battery is almost out. On the plus side, when I pop them back in the case for even 15 minutes, they charge fast. At night, I charge the case and within maybe 15‚Äì30 minutes, it's all charged up, so I can then charge my phone.I'm not sure that the background cancelling works well or that there's much if any difference, according to people I've been on the phone with.

The quality is alright but could be better. My biggest disappointment was how they aren‚Äôt too compatible with Siri. I‚Äôm a delivery driver so I can‚Äôt always pull out my phone to unlock it and reply to texts. I came from air pods and air pods will read you texts as they come and let you reply WITHOUT unlocking your phone. These beats DO NOT do that, they won‚Äôt read texts and if you ask if you have new messages it will require you to unlock your phone. Also the Siri voice sounds a little muffled and it doesn‚Äôt always pick up what you say when you do use voice to text. That‚Äôs the most disappointing thing about these, I thought since they were bought out by Apple years ago they would imply the same software but no.Overall they‚Äôre decent, nothing to out of the ordinary.The noise canceling is nice. They also come with different sized rubber attachments so you can swap them out if they don‚Äôt fit right.Another thing I might add is that they‚Äôre a little bulky. The first few days of using them my ears would be sore just from wearing them. Again on sale they‚Äôre worth it ($80) but at full price ($150) I would‚Äôve been much more disappointed.Overall the sound quality is crisp but I personally feel like it could use a little more bass, these tend to be louder with the quality of voice over the quality of the music.That being said the battery life is okay, it‚Äôs nice that the case charges them.

R3DP5AYVDBKQJZ,B096SV8SJG,3.0 out of 5 stars Won‚Äôt Stay Stay Paired - Sound Cuts Out,Beth,3,"As far as sound quality goes, I would give these earbuds a four. Battery life was also good. Another positive is the controls on the earbuds work relatively well compared to many others. The problem comes in the fact that the sound will pop in and out intermittently while you are exercising or walking. The biggest problem I had and the reason for the low rating is that they will come unpaired sometimes if you pull an earbud out of your ear and they will not re-pair on your phone by turning Bluetooth on or off or anything else. The only way to get them to re-pair is to put them back in their charge box and pull them back out again. That doesn‚Äôt do any good when their charging box is hours away and you‚Äôre out exercising.

R3W0SAGT4F2CDC,B0BZ9WMLNQ,3.0 out of 5 stars decent,Guru,3,"On the positive side, the sound quality of these earbuds is impressive. The audio is clear and well-balanced, making them great for listening to music, podcasts, and phone calls. The Bluetooth connectivity is seamless with Android devices, and the quick pairing feature is very convenient. Additionally, the fit is comfortable, and they stay secure during workouts and daily activities.However, there are a few drawbacks that affect the overall experience. Firstly, the touch controls can be overly sensitive and sometimes unresponsive, which can be frustrating when trying to pause, play, or skip tracks. Secondly, the battery life, while decent, doesn‚Äôt quite match up to some competitors in the same price range. I found myself needing to recharge them more frequently than I would have liked.Another issue is the lack of noise cancellation. While they do an okay job at passive noise isolation, they struggle in louder environments, which can impact the listening experience in busy settings. Additionally, the absence of volume control on the earbuds themselves is inconvenient, requiring me to use my phone to adjust the volume.","Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2024",AFZ62B2ONA6QTX6J5M6MRVL7Q3KA,TRUE,1,Color: Clearly WhiteStyle: Pixel Buds

RDW8UQ9AOCJJ9,B0BZ9WMLNQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Decent,Amazon Customer,4,"I ordered these for my Pixel 6 Pro because I needed bluetooth headphones quickly, otherwise I would have waited for the new Pro buds that came out a short while after I ordered these.Overall, I like these but I have a few issues.One, all three ear fitting sizes don't work great with the shape of my ear canal, I guess, because they are pushed out and I am constantly pushing them back in. They have almost fallen in the trash, down the sink and in the litter box when I have leaned/bent over. I am not using these buds during physical activity such as running or working out, this is just in the kitchen while cooking or doing household chores. This is inconvenient and aggravating. If I did some research, I am sure I could find other shapes in ear fittings to remedy this issue, and this issue does not reflect on the quality of the headphones themselves.Two, the battery life. For music and talking on the phone, I find the battery life to be as much as one should expect but not as much I would want. I hope the Pro buds have longer battery duration. I use my ear buds everyday, for as little as an hour/2 hours for talking on the phone, or as long for music. I understand not everyone will need to be on the phone as long as I do, but if you were looking for these for working from home or instead of a headset at work, they aren't advisable for that.Three, the noise filter/cancelation. When using in the car, I have had complaints of the road/wind/traffic being louder than my voice to the person am talking to. Also, I have had complaints that noises like doing dishes/opening a bag to add to the trash can is extremely loud to the person on the other end. For noise cancelation, I think it does decent enough but I think the feature the Pro has called Transparency mode where you can fade in/out of cancelation would be more useful.These are comfortable in your ear when they aren't popping out, the sound quality of the music and the voice of the other person on a phone call is great. The voice assistant I haven't used much but it's been very responsive when I have used it. I can't call my husband via voice because he is saved as 'hubby' in my contacts, and when I ask Google to call Hubby, she says, ok what's your husband's name? then can't find him in my phone. Oh well. All in all these headphones are worth getting over off-brands, but I would save for the Pros if I was honest.","Reviewed in the United States August 19, 2022",AF7LQSBFPTYESEVB3N3NKS6IM4PA,TRUE,45,Color: Dark OliveStyle: Pixel Buds

Used exclusively for gym, elliptical (watching videos on tablet) and running (mostly sprint intervals), with MP3 player, not phone.. I am not listening to violin concertos, just trance/rock music, generally with a fair amount of background noise, so sound quality doesn't need to be concert hall quality. Isolation could be better, but lots of runners don't like isolation for safety reasons. Wing keeps them firmly in place without being uncomfortable to me. Easy to load music, easy to connect to mp3 player and tablet, easy to make Bluetooth connection, no interruptions even when in shorts pocket and running hard. Only thing it lacks from my standpoint is volume control link to mp3 player, find myself sometimes have to grab player and adjust volume (volume variation likely attributable to download variations). I have had such a satisfactory experience with these I have considered upgrading to the Pixel Buds Pros which have touch volume controls, but I worry about them falling out during runs, and also price at 50-100% more, not sure they would be worth it.","Reviewed in the United States March 1, 2024",AEKZM63RGQN5QMHLQC4ZIUQHV3YA,TRUE,1,Color: Dark OliveStyle: Pixel Buds

And I just had to get myself a pair.The Good:- battery life is solid- sound quality punches well above the class of anything else you could pick up for the price I got them at ($40 on sale)- pairing is dead easy (on Pixel phones)- USB-C charging, unlike many other budget wireless buds- I've never lost the connection of one earbud and then had to reset and pair again like I have with other buds- touch controls are good, sensitive but not too sensitive, and work wellThe Meh:- removing one earbud pauses whatever you're watching or listening to. I wish I could switch that off sometimes. Sometimes, I just want a single earbud in! And having to find a place to put the other earbud that triggers the proximity sensor to let things keep playing can be a bit of a hassleThe Bad: if you order them in different colors, say, for yourself and another person, the cases will look very similar.

R2OQM5XLDBPKDP,B0BZ9WMLNQ,5.0 out of 5 stars They do the job for what I needed,N. Arr,5,"I'll be honest, I loose technology....often. As a result I never bought expensive earbuds. I would always buy the $30 and under option because inevitably I was going to misplace them and could not stomach the idea of loosing a $100 item within a few weeks of purchase. However after 3 years of COVID required zoom calls my coworkers chipped in and bought me the Google pixel buds. There was an immediate difference for me in regards to what I could hear and the experience for anyone talking to me on the other side. Here are the highlights1. The noise cancellation works well. In the past people would complain they can't hear me clearly because of all the background noise. As if I were at a construction site when I simply was opening a bag of chips!2. Sound quality is perfect. Can't tell you how many times with other earbuds I would be told can you get closer to the phone, or that I sounded far away, or was I underwater etc etc. But with these it's Crystal clear no issues at all.3. Battery lasts long enough. I find that these last most of my work day. I tend to average about five hours of meetings a day and in that capacity they last.4. Charge speed is quick. When I do need to charge these for from 0-100% in like 20mins. To be fair I don't think I have ever let them get to 0. Overall I don't find myself charging them often and the charging case really does do a good job of charging the actual buds quickly if I do run into a problem.5. Ear buds do slip out. I have found an occasion that a slight tap will accidentally send the earbuds falling out of my ear. I've changed the size of the ear cushion but doesn't really seem to lock in well like other earbuds I have tried. So that is one point off for them but nothing insurmountable that would detract from the overall score.Overall for the price I think these are great. So much so that I did in fact lose the ones my coworker bought me within about 6 weeks and ended up buying my own pair thankfully they were on sale.

R2N6GLU60E0O70,B0BZ9WMLNQ,5.0 out of 5 stars They're FINE.,Quentin,5,"Ok, so I really only bought these because I was curious about the difference between the $10-20 earbuds I was used to using (with no real functional complaints) versus a more expensive, near-premium experience. I had also just bought a Pixel phone, so I figured, what the heck, let's get the ecosystem since I'd never fully done that before (I also bought the Pixel watch). And honestly, while they're fine and the audio is great and the easy connection to a Google phone is convenient, I'm not sure it's $60-80 better than the cheap stuff we buy and replace all the time. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's nice to have Google assistant on call, handsfree, especially after I've gotten so used to using it at home that I sometimes call out to Google in public places only to catch myself mid ‚ÄùHey Goo-."" But honestly, most earbuds at least allow you to press and call Google or Alexa, so again, my quibble isn't we with the buds being good. They are. But if you're a practical spender like me and also have a tight budget (or just don't want to spend more than you have to), I'd put it like this: these earbuds are more than worth the money if calling Google assistant anywhere, at anytime with just a whisper is super important to you. Otherwise, save a few bucks and get something in the $40-60 range and you'll still get 95% of what comes with these. But if you have the money to spend and don't care too much, yeah, these are fine. They fit fine, they last for a decent amount of time, and the charging case feels premium. But I was a bit underwhelmed after using em for a bit because I guess I expected something that would fundamentally raise my expectations for earbuds moving forward and I don't think these did that. I'll probably still switch between these and my $10 buds from time to time, probably keeping these in the car since the house wired with Google inside.","Reviewed in the United States December 8, 2022",AGJSG3XDDL5RCKG5D646IJTVF3TA,TRUE,40,Color: CharcoalStyle: Pixel Buds
RF574C7KF8UQK,B0BZ9WMLNQ,5.0 out of 5 stars By far the best pair of earbuds/phones I've ever owned,BTC,5,"The Pixel Buds are unquestionably the best set of ear-anything I've ever owned. Combined with my Pixel 6 XL, the buds are picked up instantaneously upon being removed from the case. The battery life is excellent and the case holds several additional charges. Thus far I've never run out of a charge. Not even sure I've gone below 75%, honestly.The best part about these, which can't be said for many other buds, is that you don't have to pair them to use them. You can use one of them and then switch over to the other if you want to maximize battery life (or simply don't want to or can't use both at the same time). This feature is often reserved for buds that are much more expensive than these.My final comment - and perhaps the most important - is the fit. Absolutely perfect. I have avoided buds over the years at all costs because I can just never get them to sit right in my ear. They fall out, they hurt, whatever. I do a lot of work around the house and get sweaty (I live in Florida, tough not to be sweaty...) and have had buds just drop out of my ear because of that. Never has that happened yet with these buds. They're so comfortable you can forget they're even in there.Do yourself a favor and pick these up. Top notch all around.","Reviewed in the United States September 24, 2023",AGBJX6HZBSAZYMTNWHT623RPZMOA,TRUE,19,Color: Clearly WhiteStyle: Pixel Buds

R3VEOTHXAN30WJ,B0BZ9WMLNQ,3.0 out of 5 stars Good but they don't last long enough and charging can be an issue,the weathered man,3,"I've had my Pixel Buds A series for a couple months shy of a year. I've really enjoyed them and use them every day when I'm cooking breakfast. They might get up to 1 hour a day use from me. The sound quality is very good, they are comfortable in the ears, and I like how well they work with my Pixel phone. I like the appearance, charging case and fit/finish of these more than AirPods.Recently the left earbud lost at least 50% of its volume, and is fading more every day. It's the same thing that happens with cheaper wired earbuds after a few months... volume loss, then eventually it stops working all together. So I was disappointed that the same thing seems to be happening with these Pixel buds, which are not cheap earbuds. I take care of my earbuds and keep them clean and free of debris, so that's not the issue. Apparently these aren't built to last. I had expected these to last as long as AirPods, but that's not been my experience.One other issue I've had with them is that often when you place them back in the charging case, they don't charge. Next time you go to put them on, they don't work because they will completely discharge on their own. Apparently there's an issue with the earbud's charging pin making contact with the one in the charging case -- it doesn't always make contact. Thankfully, the case's LED blinks to let you know when it's detected the earbud and is charging it, but you just have to make sure you watch it. It often takes me a few tries before I can get it to work. This has been an issue as long as I've had these. It's only a minor annoyance and I suspect it's a minor design flaw that they'll eventually remedy in manufacturing.","Reviewed in the United States September 12, 2023",AE6VEADNLEN5YHTMN4MSR6IB75IA,TRUE,19,Color: Clearly WhiteStyle: Pixel Buds

I can easily switch from my phone to laptop with ease. The case doubles as a sensory tool during meetings or while out walking. Charging the case takes a minute but it holds a charge well once it's fully charged. I think I've been able to charge my buds 2 or 3 times before needing to charge the case again.Buds seem to last longer during phones calls than meetings (thinks zoom) or listening to music (think YouTube).Noise cancellation is good!

Oh yeah, they can only connect to one device at a time.","Reviewed in the United States September 29, 2023",AGRQ5LTYXADYWJRFP5FKQDLFHIRQ,TRUE,4,Color: CharcoalStyle: Pixel Buds

I didn't need the pro version, because I'm not going to be using them daily, but when I do need them they're wonderful. Very versatile, with nice touch button controls, and you can even still use the assistant on these by holding down on the outer pad. So you can still use features like volume control, and they also let you pause, skip forward, rewind back, all the features that you would traditionally be looking for.

RTTFYIVPAN2JD,B0BZ9WMLNQ,5.0 out of 5 stars A great set of Earbuds for a non-premium price,Seth McNew,5,"I was kind of skeptical at first when I decided to buy these - there were other earbuds I was considering at the time at around the same price range, and I had a pair of $20 buds at home that were still somewhat working. But, I decided to take a shot and honestly, I'm really surprised with how well these work.Bluetooth communication between the buds and my Pixel 6 have been amazing outside of one weird incident towards the beginning where music was choppy, but a quick restart on my phone fixed that. I've left my phone in my office a few times, and I can get a pretty good distance before noticing dropouts too, so it's nice not to always need the phone on my hip for these to work. Though, these do not support multipoint - afraid if you want to connect to multiple devices at the same time with a Pixel bud, you'll need to step up to the Pixel Buds Pro.Audio quality has been really good as well. I'm no audiophile by any means, but I do listen to a lot of EDM/Techno/Jazz and nothing really sounds muted. There is a setting to do Bass Boost within the Bluetooth settings that silently get installed when pairing the Buds for the first time to your phone, but I've yet to experiment with it. ANC isn't a feature on here, but just the fit of the earbuds do isolate the music to some degree from the world around. And the fit was surprisingly comfortable - the extra wing of support keeps the buds in place well that I rarely have to adjust them.Lastly, I was kind of worried about the battery before purchasing. I'd prefer something that would last my whole work day, and surprisingly, these do! Mind you, I typically only have a single bud in while I'm working because a lot of people walk into my office, but I'll swap buds around lunch time when it starts to get low on battery. They charge quickly - I'd say I could pull out my bud in about 20 minutes to it being mostly, if not fully charged. From this, I'd say I get about a week's worth of battery charge with the case.My only major complaint is that I hate that there's no tactile buttons on the buds themselves. You have to tap the G on your earbuds to bring up the Assistant, stop/play music, etc. but sometimes I'll be tapping all around the bud just trying to find that sweet spot because touch detection can be a little iffy. But, compared to my previous earbud set, this is a significant upgrade.","Reviewed in the United States September 22, 2022",AEJOJYUEQYWVBUETOZOM4Q3UCELQ,TRUE,55,Color: Dark OliveStyle: Pixel Buds

RB54OKL32JRKE,B0BZ9WMLNQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Wireless Showdown: Pixel Buds in the Ring,Heather A. Turner,5,"Venturing into the realm of the Google Pixel Buds, I embarked on a journey of exploration that spanned across platforms, including iPhone and Windows computer usage. This review aims to offer a comprehensive perspective on the capabilities of these wireless earbuds, in comparison to other popular options. To be honest I tried them out because they were on supersale during Prime Day. So why not!The Pixel Buds shine brightly in several aspects. Their design, minimalistic and comfortable, ensures a snug fit suitable for both workouts and daily activities. The sound quality, characterized by crisp audio and punchy bass, impressed me across a variety of musical genres. Google's adaptive sound feature, dynamically adjusting volume based on surroundings, further enhanced the listening experience.As an iPhone user I love Airpods but they are pretty pricey. Speaking of alternatives, let's talk about the AirPods. The Pixel Buds stack up well in terms of sound quality and the real-time translation feature, giving them a distinct edge. I have found the battery to be pretty good and have not had to recharge nearly as often as my Airpod Pros.Considering the AirPods, while they integrate seamlessly with Apple devices, the Pixel Buds' compatibility with different platforms is a plus. Additionally, the Pixel Buds' noise canceling and translation capabilities broaden their appeal beyond audio quality alone.To sum it up, the Google Pixel Buds offer a solid package. Their design, audio quality, and innovative features position them as strong contenders in the wireless earbud market. Though a few minor drawbacks exist, they deliver an enjoyable audio journey. Whether you lean towards the Google ecosystem or seek versatile wireless earbuds with modern touches, the Pixel Buds are well worth your consideration.

I decided to bite the bullet and buy these mostly because of the price and that they are Google like my 7 pro. I've had several buds favorite being a pair of Bose that are discontinued, sounded great connected easily and after several years and my sweat , maybe not cleaning them better, they are pretty beat up. Still working but controls have fallen off hahah. Ok back to the review, issues trying to hang up a call , can't ever tell unless I'm staring at my cell, should have some sort of confirmation sound or something.Additionally, Not having a separate app for them is where I feel it's a unfulfilling and limited experience. You can't tailor the sound, they are not very loud; obviously buds would not be safe to use if too loud but my other buds both Bose still sound better only slightly because the difference in volume, the Google buds do shine when talking fidelity. I have some other less known over the head headphones and earbuds by Soundcore which sounds good but these are super clear just no adjustments. I download an equalizer app which helps.I can live with most of these small shortcomings since they were not very expensive but for 100 dollars I would have like better controls , better fit. I have the same fit issues as other reviews have mentioned. I don't like over the ear buds with the little accessories to hold in place so I stick with this type. The other ones I have which are the Bose beat up and all from sweat and the Soundcore earbuds fit much better. Google little case is annoying too, should have come with a little cord to secure the charging case or at least a less slippery material for the surface, Im always feeling I'm going to lose it at the gym or anywhere. Still think of returning them but trying to work with them cause although the are not very loud they do sound great.

Seemed borderline fake to me. The actual product inside seems nice, fairly light and small but not too light as to feel unreliable. There is no indicator light anywhere on the case that would give a clue about the status of the pairing, battery etc. Pairing supposed to work simply by opening the lid near your phone. Nothing happened when I opened it (other than a low level sound effect coming from the case. I did charge it, so that should not be the problem.) Then I tried pairing manually but the device does not show up anywhere among the paired devices or list of devices available to pair. Then I tried following the instructions on their dedicated product page. For Android it says that one should download the Beats App from the Play store. And so I did, but this specific model, SOLO BUDS, is not listed as an available product to pair.

Beats are known to be particularly good for bass-heavy music; I have a pair of Beats over ear headphones and they are decent. These earbuds however do not live up to the reputation.Pros:* I was excited to see how small the case is for these earphones. It is significantly smaller and lighter than the typical Apple airpods case, for example. I ordered in the translucent red and it is a cool look. I like being able to see the electronics within the case (the buds are solid color red).* the form factor and related design of the buds is excellent. They are covered in a rubberized material typical for sports electronics, making them water and sweat resistant as well as mostly impervious to dirt. the fit in the ear is really good, and they come with multiple sets of ear tips in matching color. They do not fall out of my ear despite use during sports / exercise.* sound quality for phone use is very good. I can hear well and callers can hear me. They hold up to reasonable background noise.* sound quality for podcasts and other spoken word is also good. I can hear clearly and volume is sufficient.* iphone integration is decent. The earbud controls appear on iphone in a similar fashion to airpods.* battery life is good. I would estimate 10-12 hrs on a single charge.* they come with a 1-year warrranty from Apple (as documented in the product guide)Cons:*sound quality with music is only so-so. I was frankly disapointed. They do not hold up well in an A-B comparison with my Apple Airpod Pros (2nd generation) - a decent Mid-Fi option. In my opinion these are unsuitable for listening to music.* no case battery. The reason the case is so much smaller is because the case itself cannot charge the ear buds without being plugged in. I guess this is ok since the battery life on the ear buds is very good compared with others, but it was a surprise to me.* missing my favorite airpod feature - automatic pause. On my airpods, if I take one out of my ear the source pauses. Seems like a missed opportunity given the existing integration.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AFQNCPIKKEK67YQSJQXF2UKQML4A,FALSE,0,Color: Transparent RedStyle: Solo Buds
R1LERTLVVTROBV,B0D3JB14QS,4.0 out of 5 stars Beats Solo Buds: Compact Sound Titans in a Budget-Friendly Package,JAYSIN,4,"The Beats Solo Buds are a testament to the brand's **continued attention to sound quality**, delivering an auditory experience that impresses at its price point. While they may lack a battery within the case, reducing the overall listening time, the buds themselves offer an **excellent battery life**. In testing, they lasted just shy of **17.5 hours**, though individual results may vary slightly. Their portability is a significant advantage, making them a convenient choice for on-the-go music enthusiasts.It's true, the absence of an **IP rating** for water and sweat resistance, along with the lack of noise canceling or spatial audio features, might be seen as downsides. However, these omissions are somewhat mitigated by the buds' affordability. The removal of the indicator light, a seemingly small feature we've all come to rely on, is a curious choice by Apple. It's akin to a phone without a camera; it functions, but something feels amiss. Now, users must rely on their phones to check the battery life and confirm if the charging cable is properly connected. For iPhone users, this information is conveniently displayed via an on-screen card, while Android users can find it in the app.Despite these quirks, the Beats Solo Buds strike a balance between **size, sound quality, and price** that many will find just right. For those seeking alternatives, the Soundcore Space A40 offers a similar size, more overall battery life, a wireless charging case, and comparable sound quality with a bit more sub-bass impact. They also boast a comfortable fit with ANC and an actual **IPX4 rating**, all at a price point that's often under $50 on sale, available in black, blue, and white‚Äîall of which are quite stylish. Ultimately, the Beats Solo Buds stand out for their portability and sound quality, making them a worthy consideration for those prioritizing these features within this price range.","Reviewed in the United States June 22, 2024",AER7PTMSQZFO5CNGSYDORW6DEDGQ,FALSE,6,Color: Transparent RedStyle: Solo Buds

These paired easily and quickly with my phone and come with a great slim carry case which also keeps the earbuds charged. They also come with various ear tips so you can customize the fit. They stay in my ears even if I shake my head hard so that's good too. I still prefer earbuds with a silicone piece that locks them into my ears though. Mostly what I don't like about these is the sound quality. There is just something off about the sound. It has this distant quality to it that seems strange.

R3KI9GNXUTY8X4,B0D3JB14QS,3.0 out of 5 stars Doesn't live up to the brand name,Cheesy,3,"TL;DR - Great fit and comfort, pretty, average sound quality. Expensive.Beats has really made a name for itself as a brand and is considered a higher end option for sound. When I received this pair of earbuds, my impression was that it sounds the same as my skullcandy buds... For a brand that advertises itself as being a first choice for music buffs who are invested in quality sound, I couldn't tell much of a difference. There is no EQ setting to tinker with in an app like I've seen in some other earbuds that market themselves as musically superior. In fact, the Beats app seems to only exist to show you adds for more Beats.But, I am not picky about my earbuds. I usually pick based on pricing, comfort, and convenience over sound quality. That being said, these buds fit in the ear much easier AND more comfortably than the skullcandy ones I've used in the past. They are extremely comfortable and do not fall out. The case (transparent red) is very attractive and slim and the lid doesn't fly open accidentally to make you risk losing a bud.Ultimately, they are better than previous earbuds I've used, but only in comfort and fit, not in sound. I don't know if I'd shell out an extra $40 for these just for a more comfortable fit vs. the $39.99 competitor.TL;DR - Great fit and comfort, pretty, average sound quality.

If that is your expectation too, then get ready to be disappointed as I was. The sound on these is not great and really falls flat. The range is just poor, and I can't find any way to adjust it in the app.At $80 I guess I can't complain about it too much, but I thought I was sacrificing things like a battery in the case not actual sound performance.The fit is ok, but multiple times they have fallen out while using on the elliptical and the controls are hard to use because they are physical buttons that force movement of the bud when pressing. On the plus side you don't accidentally pause your music when readjusting like the touch sensitive ones do.Personally, I don't see these as being a daily driver. I think I will throw them in my travel bag so if I forget to pack or don't have room for my primaries, I at least have something.Overall, I don't recommend these, there are much better options in this price range, beats really missed the mark on this release!","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AHY5C3OQ4B5WHDQSIPWGFTRCPV2Q,FALSE,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: Solo Buds

They represent Beats' approach to minimalist function, design, but kind of miss the mark.These buds are small. You do have several options of sizing for yours ears, but once those things are in, you want to be careful operating the touch controls as each slight tap feels as though you may be pushing them further into your ear canals.Sound wise, I wasn't too impressed. The highs/mids were decent, but the bass seemed lacking a bit compared to other buds that I've used. I can't really say much on the ANC as I didn't really need it. With enough volume, everything outside was pretty much muted...typical of this style of earbud.There was an app that requested to download that allowed for manipulation of some features, but having to install an app and give up permissions can often be concerning.For phones conversations, these weren't bad. You could hear someone on them pretty well, though I found myself sometimes asking others to speak up a bit or having to turn up my volume. However, on my end when wearing them, I could hear them fairly well.Overall, I'm giving a 3 star.","Reviewed in the United States July 3, 2024",AF7KO44UUWM5HRSMTFYCUQI56VOA,FALSE,0,Color: Storm GrayStyle: Solo Buds

R3CG9KMYIHUOFI,B0D3JB14QS,1.0 out of 5 stars Mediocre sound; lacking features; works with iPhone,Anne Swan,1,"This is a very disappointing product from Beats. I've had the fantastic Power Beats Pro ear buds with ear hooks and lots of features for a couple years, so I expected more from this product--even at the low price point. First, the positive features: they were easy to pair with my iPhone 15 Pro Max. They also came with some charge; they do hold a charge for a long time and charge up quickly. The built in microphone worked for phone calls. The best feature was that the XS ear tips fit my small ear canal; I've not ever had an ear bud type that actually staying in my ear before--a first! The translucent red case and the red earbuds are attractive. The small case is portable, but frankly, I have no problem taking my slightly larger Power Beats Pro case anywhere I need it.Now, for the other aspects: The ""selling"" feature of this is its small size. Frankly, it makes it harder to maneuver, to get the buds out of the case and into ears. But most importantly, the sound is mediocre or less. There is no noise cancelling, and for some reason I have the volume setting on my iPhone turned as high as it will go and the sound on the earbud is at a low volume. Why won't the volume increase as typical speakers or headphones? Turns out I need some unnamed app to control the volume. But the instructions don't name the app. Also, I was unable to locate the app in the Apple App store. All I could find was an app for Beats Pill.As others have mentioned, the sound is in the high and mid-range--so the base is missing in the rock music and the classical music I prefer. I've had sound this ""good"" from cheap wired pairs. I would have liked some indication of which is right and left. The buds are very small, and I find it tricky to align them in the proper way to get them in the case. There is no noise cancelling feature; other offerings around this price point offer that. Also, this doesn't come with a cable or plug. I happen to have several USB-C cables and plugs, but if you don't have one, there's another expense. AIn my opinion, the positive features don't overcome the poor sound quality and the lack of noise cancelling. These do not make listening fun.

Just looking at them, I figured the fit would be an issue, but they fit my ears great. The sound of them when working properly was pretty good and they offer pretty impressive bass response for ear buds. This is unfortunately where the positives end.As marks on the negative side, the buttons on the side of the earbuds you can use to perform different functions are terrible. They are hard to find even when you know where they are and you have to press on them way too firmly to get them to work. I don't really want to have to shove the earbud halfway to my brain to depress the button. For the price point, you would expect noise cancellation and ambient mode. Nope, like Charlie Sheen they have one speed. Onto the most damning aspect, the left earbud quit working after only about 10 uses. That's right, 10 uses. I have had ear buds that cost less than half that outlasted these by years.Beats is a name that should be synonymous with quality.

R3ACA4BFELO1SS,B0D3JB14QS,3.0 out of 5 stars Apple/Beats is walking a middle line with these,This Is Not,3,"I've been using these the last couple of days as my everyday drivers. I have tried Beats earbuds before, mainly the Studio Buds and the Studio Buds+. Neither stayed in my ears without relying on foam ear tips. So, I never fully switched to them and returned them for other products. I have a pair of old PowerBeats Pro, but I stopped using them a while back because they don't have ANC and rely on Lightning for charging (which should be a sin in 2024). I've always wanted to like the Studio Buds and Buds+ due to their design and overall solid build, but they never stayed in my ears.The same holds true with the Solo Buds. They're just like the Studio Buds+, just a little smaller and lighter. If the Studio Buds/Buds+ didn't stay in your ears, these ones won't either. I went through all the different ear tip sizes and medium fit me the best, but I had to push the right earbud back into my ear every hour or so.While I had these in my ears, I was able to do some listening. They popped up on my iPhone 15 Pro Max like all other Beats and Apple earbuds/headphones. You get some options in the iOS settings and the drop down menu. Unlike AirPods, these do not feature head tracking for spatial audio (though they do work with spatial audio, so does ANY pair of earbuds or headphones) or any ANC whatsoever. The charging case does not have a battery in it either. These earbuds last for about 17 hours (Apple advertises 18 hours) when I listened to them at about 75% volume.One thing that took me back was just how quiet these were. I had the same issue with the Studio Buds+. I have Soundcheck turned on in Apple Music due to listening to Atmos/Spatial tracks. It turns up their volume to match the volume of other tracks in my library while normalizing track volumes across the board. Still, I have other earbuds and headphones from Sony, Moondrop, and Heavys that don't require my iPhone's volume set to 75% for comfortable listening.Although the battery life is exceptional, charging these is a pain. Like I said, the case doesn't have a battery in it which means you need to be near a power source to recharge these. The case doesn't have a charging indicator light, so you don't know the charging state of the earbuds. Are they full, half, or somewhere between? I don't know, you need to lift their lid to find out. The bottom of the case is flat, just like Sony's case for their WF-1000XM5 earbuds (my everyday pair after I test others). It works for Sony because the case supports Qi charging. The Solo Buds case is begging to have a Qi charger in it. That would have helped immensely with the charging situation. Plop them on a Qi charger with an indicator light and wait for it to turn off. At least then you could tell when the earbuds were fully charged.But nope, Apple cut corners here and the case's only purpose is to take power from the back USB-C port and pipe it to the prongs connecting to the earbuds.Overall, the sound quality is fine, albeit very generic. Bass isn't boosted, neither are trebles. I would say this is a slight V-shaped curve, but not much. People expecting a bass boosted profile should know that these fit in the current Beats sound signature of things being flatter and more accurate. It's a little baffling given the history of Beats and that most people, especially those buying mainstream audio products, like a V-shaped sound signature with boosted lows and highs.I listened to modern pop, some metal, hard rock, and dubstep. It all sounded fine. Details were there, but not as much as my Sony WF-1000XM5. But I expected that given the price difference between these and the Sony earbuds (they MSRP for over 4X as much). There isn't wear detection or anything else fancy. Microphone quality is fine, it works but they do let in more outside noise than I'm used to. There isn't any special microphone noise cancelling like with other earbuds. If there is, I'm not hearing it.The biggest reason why I gave these 3 stars and not more is because, compared to other earbuds, these are far too expensive and should be in the $30 price range. Take the Soundcore A40 earbuds. They MSRP for $80 but are routinely on sale for $60 (sometimes even $50). They have less battery life, ""only"" 10 hours compared to 18. But that 10 hour battery life is while using ANC. It isn't the best ANC, but it's ANC nonetheless and that's something the Solo Buds do not have.The Soundcore A40 also have a companion app letting you adjust the EQ to your liking. It isn't an advanced EQ, but it's better than nothing and I think they sound much better than the Solo Buds. They aren't as quite and my iPhone sits at about 40-50% volume instead of 75% for comfortable listening (not even loud listening). The Soundcore A40 have a case featuring a battery and you can recharge the earbuds 4 more times. Their case also features Qi and USB-C charging with an indicator light. You know the rough battery percentage for the earbuds without popping the lid open. You can place the A40 case on a Qi charger and it will recharge both the case and earbuds without issues.For $20 less (right now), you can get a much better pair of earbuds from Soundcore/Anker that have more features and better sound quality. They don't have a fancy animation when you open them next to your iPhone or Android phone, but you get so much more out of them.Honestly, if Apple put a $30 price sticker on these, I would fully recommend them. You're getting neutral sounding earbuds with some smart features (mainly pairing and automatic spatial audio on iPhones). For $30, it's fine to miss a few features like wear detection and the lack of a battery in the charging case. But, at their current full MSRP (or even down to $50), these just aren't worth it, not for the compromises. If you really need to stick with the Beats brand, I think the Beats Flex are a better buy because they include an Apple chip (better iPhone compatibility) and you can put wing tips on them without ruining their compatibility with a charging case.I've also found the microphone quality to be better with the Beats Flex, it's probably because the microphone is closer to your mouth. I also think the Beats Flex sound better. They're still missing tons of smart features, but they're also often available for $50. They also have a charging indicator light.Honestly, I'm not sure what Apple was thinking with these at their full MSRP. You're paying for a little popup on your iPhone/Android and the Beats name, nothing more. Save money and go with Soundcore/Anker for better earbuds and an overall better package. Either that or, if you really want Beats, get the Beats Flex or wait for these to drop down to $35. They aren't worth more than that.","Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2024",AHIDDYIZWNSZJVM4NNK5Y3ISPKAQ,FALSE,0,Color: Transparent RedStyle: Solo Buds

Tested them out.If you bought these because of bass and you love bass, the bass selections that are already on the app don‚Äôt work at all and only add just about 5 percent extra bass if you chose one.You‚Äôd have to play with the EQ in order to get the bass to work. Since I love speakers a lot and find them fun to use and enjoy the bass part. I‚Äôve messed with the EQ on my phone and got the bass where it‚Äôs strong and sounds good but also to where you can still hear it.I also found out that clear to the right on EQ, if you wanted to hear more of the voice, then move the label 4K up higher. It will decrease the bass by a small percentage but still give you that advantage to listen to the bass and still hear the voice louder.Lowering the 4K will add more bass and lower the voice.I‚Äôve provided screenshots of what my configurations are on the EQ and what my general settings are for these earbuds from JBL.My final review is the color is cool, the case is well durable, the earbuds themself are comfortable in your ears, they work well and have a high volume sound. They last a good amount of hours as well which is a big + for me.I did notice someone had posted a review regarding the EQ, I‚Äôve used their EQ style and it flattens the bass and does not give you the bass you want.

R10T5CDIG6Q5UX,B0BQPNMXQV,5.0 out of 5 stars Top quality audio after a few adjustments,P. Dobrinen,5,"This review is about the audio features of the JBL Vibe Beam earbuds.I'm an audio engineer so audio quality is very important to me. As such, I use wired connections as much as possible to maintain the integrity of the audio signal. However, many newer consumer-level products no longer have audio jacks, so I finally decided to invest in some wireless earbuds as a backup to the other earphones and headphones that I use. I didn't want to spend a lot of money as I didn't foresee myself using this product very much, and since this is my first foray into wireless audio earphones, if they were just ok or they broke after a while, then I wouldn't feel too bad about the little money that I spent. Also, I wanted to focus on finding wireless earbuds with excellent audio quality first as I already have an excellent high-end bluetooth earpiece for cell phone use, and I wouldn't be using this product as a bluetooth headset for my phone.After doing much research, I chose the JBL Vibe Beam's as they were at my price point, I'm familiar with JBL products, and I could reasonably expect that they were likely deliver the high audio quality that I've come to expect from JBL products. In my research, I read reviews that complained about the harshness of the high end with high frequency instruments like cymbals or the lack of bass, so I was a bit concerned.When I received and started listening to my JBL Vibe Beams I understood what people were talking about. However, to correct the issues, first, one must have a great fit of the earbuds in their ears. I'm fortunate, in that with the medium tips that were already installed on the Vibe Beams, they made a snug fit in my ears right out of the box. If you find that these earbuds do not fit well in your ears it might be worthwhile to invest in a separate set of variable sized earbud tips, or try tips from one of your other well-fitting earbuds, if you have them. Once the earbuds were seated properly in my ear, that took care of the poor bass issue. (I have not worn them long-term so I can't speak to them falling out of my ear, as others have mentioned, but they seem to stay in pretty well.)For the misaligned frequency response issue, fortunately, the JBL Headphone app that you can install on your cell phone includes a ten-band graphic equalizer that you can use to make adjustments to the frequency response of your earbuds. After listening to several of the reference tracks I use to check new audio equipment or my mixes against, I found that the only adjustments needed were carving out some of the upper midrange and making a very slight boost in the bottom end of the lower frequency spectrum. I've included a screenshot of my EQ curve which I based on the Bass preset in the JBL app. You can't tell as there is no dB scale on the side, but I needed to cut or boost by only 1-2 dB. I find that my new EQ curve gives a more balanced frequency response than what came out of the box, and matches up well against the reference speaker system and headphones that I use for my audio mixing and mastering work. I invite you to use my EQ curve as a starting point and adjust as sounds best to you.I also read reviews complaining about the apparent lack of volume of the Vibe Beams. I connected the JBL's to several different sources (phone, computer, TV, MP3 player, etc.) and I found that the overall maximum volume (with limiter off) is relatively lower than wired speaker versions. However, the input to the JBL's is relative to the maximum output of the source itself. I found that the loudest level I could get came from my iPhone and the lowest level output came from my MP3 player (which probably doesn't offer much output anyway being a tiny portable unit). As a comparison, I did a side-by-side test of the JBL's with my wife's AirPods (2nd gen). What I found was that the JBL's offered an almost identical audio output level as the AirPods with any of the sources I used so that confirmed that the output level of the JBL's has more to do with the source (and the source material as some songs are mastered at a lower volume than other songs) than with the earbuds themselves. During my test, I put the JBL's at their maximum volume output (one tap at a time on the left bud to raise the volume). Also, I noticed during my testing that the AirPods had a pleasing midrange sound perfect for listening to podcasts or watching video, but the JBL's excelled at full-range sound on the bottom and top ends of the frequency spectrum which made them sound much better over all and well-suited for music or listening to explosive action scenes in movies.And speaking of movies, the JBL app has a switchable audio/video mode. The video mode reduces the latency of the delivery of audio against picture, so there isn't a noticeable lip-sync issue with dialogue in a scene. However, there is a slight degradation in the audio quality of 'video' mode versus 'audio' mode, but you will have to make the determination if the change in audio quality is acceptable to you.As a side note, I included a picture of the inner side of the earbuds. The 'L' and 'R' designations on the earbuds are tiny as you can see, plus they are the same color as the earbuds themselves, so they are very hard to see. I wish JBL had made the L/R letters bigger or at least made them a different color so they would be easier to see.The pairing process was fairly easy with all my bluetooth-capable devices and the range was good, only dropping out after walking approximately 60-70 feet from the source. There was one momentary dropout during my listening but that could be due to my wife using her AirPods the same time as I was using the JBL's.I can't speak to the other features of the JBL Vibe Beams as I don't intend to use them, but as far as audio quality goes, with just a few minor tweaks, these bluetooth earbuds can go from sounding like a $50 pair of earbuds to a $500 pair of reference earphones.","Reviewed in the United States October 21, 2023",AHY4E66OMDCFPZWPUF5YLKKGZBHA,TRUE,1022,Color: White
R2154XSZDSZH0Z,B0BQPNMXQV,"4.0 out of 5 stars Decent ear buds, but fit isn't exact and battery life is questionable",warren smith,4,"I had to replace a set of headphones that stopped working. So this time I thought I would try a set of earbuds instead. I know JBL usually have good products, price was decent, so I thought I would try these.First I will say the sound and volume are pretty good. If you are using these on your phone, the JBL app also makes a big difference with the equalizer and the other ""hear through"" type features if you don't want to block out all noise. Really wish they had a similar app for PC, as I use them on my laptop more than my phone. And is really when I need to hear people talking etc.With that said, the fit isn't great, I tried all the different sizes of the rubber covers, but none seem to fit right in my left ear for some reason. I've had it fall out once already when just bending over to pick something up off the floor.They are also difficult to get out of the case, the lid should open further or just have a way to grab a hold of them easier.The battery life is ok, but doesn't seem to be anywhere near the 32 hours listed, including the recharge feature of the case. I've gotten about half that, before they kept telling me they were ""low battery"". And I had to charge them and the case both back up.all in all, these may work good for some people. I am thinking about returning them and trying something else though.","Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2024",AFN6273O6VY3TZWBMRRXBI5BLU6Q,TRUE,11,Color: Black

As an avid music lover, I'm always on the lookout for earbuds that deliver exceptional sound quality, and these earbuds absolutely deliver. The JBL Deep Bass Sound technology truly lives up to its name, providing rich, immersive audio that brings my music to life. Whether I'm listening to my favorite tracks or taking calls on the go, the sound clarity and depth are unparalleled.One of the standout features of these earbuds is their Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity, which ensures a seamless and stable connection with my devices. I've never experienced any lag or dropouts, even when moving around in busy urban environments. Plus, the water and dust-resistant design give me peace of mind, knowing that my earbuds are protected against the elements during workouts or outdoor adventures.Comfort is also a priority for me when it comes to earbuds, and the JBL Vibe Beam doesn't disappoint. The ergonomic design and multiple ear tip options ensure a secure and comfortable fit, even during extended listening sessions. And with the hassle-free touch controls, I can easily adjust volume, skip tracks, or answer calls with just a tap.Overall, I couldn't be happier with the JBL Vibe Beam True Wireless Earbuds. They combine top-notch sound quality, reliable connectivity, and comfort in a sleek and durable package. Whether you're a music enthusiast, a fitness fanatic, or simply someone who values convenience and quality in their audio accessories, these earbuds are sure to impress.

The 'JBL Headphones' smartphone app is highly recommended as using the app will allow you to switch to and from audio and video mode. Audio mode has better sound quality and video mode syncs the sound to the video. Honestly, I don't really notice a enough difference in sound quality between the two modes so I tend to keep it in video mode so I can switch between listening to Pandora or watching YouTube without having to open the app and switch modes.The fit is very comfortable and secure in my ears. I haven't used these for working out yet but I feel like I could go jogging or hit the gym and not have to worry about losing them.

I was very impressed they are actually better than my $150 Beats were. Sound is amazing the adjustable equalizer makes getting the perfect sound for your needs easy. They fir in the ear good they ate comfortable and don't fall out like my Beats did. They are a little hard to remove from the case but that's actually a good thing I know ppl complained about that but it also means they are harder to just fall out. Another complaint was about the case being too slippery and getting scratched up easily. My Beats case was more slippery and all cases gets scratches eventually so far I haven't gotten any on these. The battery life is also a huge selling point. I'm not disappointed at all.

R3GKU4H3B5RNTI,B0BQPNMXQV,4.0 out of 5 stars excellent battery life. lots of good feature ideas that don't really work IRL.,Mavev,4,"When i purchased these I didn't know about the touch controls features. so if you touch one of them it will pause what you are listening to or if you touch the other it can adjust the volume depending on where you tap it. it's very sensitive and I find anything that touches it, hair or hat will pause your podcast. You can turn this feature off with the app. The ""find my buds"" feature in the app for this is great in theory, but pretty useless in real life practice. (I lost one of them a week after owning them.) unless they are currently on and bluetooth connected to the phone with the app you can't make it ping the bud and make a sound to find it. so despite knowing where I lost the bud and knowing i was in range I couldn't find it. So i now have one earbud.The sound quality is good but the noise cancelling isn't capable of cancelling out a mower or a weed wacker enough for you to hear what you were listening to clearly. the pass through sound feature isn't really useful either, on this scale the mic quality just isn't good enough to do that and not have people sound like old robots. It does work.. it just makes everything sound like an old mono radio broadcast.The battery life is really the best feature of these buds. I can listen for 5 hours straight and not have to put it back on the charger. I only listen to podcasts on my single remaining ear bud, maybe if you listened to something with more bass it would drain faster. but for my purposes it's perfect. I also really like that the app shows you the remaining battery percentage of each bud","Reviewed in the United States June 3, 2024",AGF33BYGZ466FJY2FSXV2CY77JLA,TRUE,6,Color: Black

There is a slight audio delay between video and audio, and the audio quality is just not that great, but I am assuming that‚Äôs apple‚Äôs doing for using a non apple product with their phone. I used to use these with a samsung product and they were awesome, liked em a lot. I mostly plan to use these to just listen to stuff, not really watch and listen, so imma keep em because screw apple. If google can make youtube worse on non chrome browsers, im sure apple can affect a device by making the quality a bit worse and purposefully putting in a delay.One month use update: my only real complaint is that they are kind of hard to put away quickly. It takes concentration because you have to rotate them before you put them away, and I have fumbled/dropped them fairly regularly when I am trying to put it away in a hurry or without looking at it. Its hard if you‚Äôre trying to put them away with anything else in your hands like a pen, book, bag/purse, sunglasses etc.The charging case could be improved if they made it so that you didn't have rotate them after you took them out of your ears in order to put them away, and if they made the stems completely rounded so that they rotated smoothly.","Reviewed in the United States June 27, 2024",AH3DCSUNI7EEVZQZDKXXSYSKTABQ,TRUE,9,Color: White

I use the right ear peice only most of the time so I can clearly hear customers and technicians, but still hear and receive messages and calls. I love how clearly I can hear people on phone calls and how well they can hear me. Unless I'm in the back shop with the loud noises from the mechanics (of course). I only get about a half of a work day before I hear the friendly female voice say ""battery low"", and I'm forced to put the right one back in the charging case and switch to the left, which is not preferable as I use my left ear to answer the work phone.My only other negative is that you can't use the find my feature if they're in the case. The other evening as I was emptying my pockets to go to bed I noticed they were missing. It turns out they fell out of my pocket while home TV and it it took me a while to find them. It would've been nice to be able to find them quicker.On the positive side though.I love the ambient aware feature so I really can have conversations without taking them out.They are comfortable and stay in my ears even on my 7 mile bike ride home after work.The sound quality for videos and music are great, no complaints there.When these die or I lose them I'll definitely stay with JBL.

R2BSZ7C5UUTNAA,B0BQPNMXQV,5.0 out of 5 stars Way better than airpods,Emily,5,"I‚Äôve had a couple different generations of AirPods as well as numerous other brands of wireless earbuds (including JBL Tune which I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of).

After some research I ended up choosing JBL Vibe Beam and felt fairly comfortable with my decision because I am a fan of JBL. I do not regret it at all. They are better than AirPods by far - piece of advice get the ‚ÄúJBL Headphones‚Äù app. The earbuds automatically come on the Jazz setting so I could see how someone wouldn‚Äôt be satisfied. You can change the equalizer (I used one of the top picture reviews and copied how they had theirs, but they also have other presets). I listen to a lot of Rap, Metal Alternative, etc. so bass is a huge thing for me and using the equalizer was a game changer. The sound is so clear and the bass is amazing. This is probably the most satisfied I‚Äôve ever been with an earbud purchase. It‚Äôs also super easy to connect them. The name showed up right away so the total process maybe took 10-15 seconds to pair them for the first time, which is pretty rare.

I've paid twice the price before and not been nearly this impressed. They bring a new clarity of sound to some albums in which I gave been previously disappointed, eg Clockwork Angels, which has always sounded muddy, even on my custom home sound system. My music tastes have a wide range; whether classical, big band jazz, prog rock, shoe gazer, etc, these buds really deliver for the price. With the app, there is good ability to adjust the sound and other settings, which is very nice, if not unique to JBL.However, there is one big caveat. With all the ear buds I have used over the years, I have never, EVER had such a pain-in-the-*$$ time getting these damn things out of their charging case!! They are stupidly hard to grasp-- they sit deep in the case, don't have a good way to grab them, and the lid very much is in the way of trying to get to them. If you buy these, know you have to be very careful and deliberate about removing them from the case or you will definitely drop them and ultimately ruin them. And if you have big fingers, seriously consider another product...unless you just get a kick out of being extremely frustrated.JBL, if you're listening (sorry for the pun), redesign the case so the ear buds rest in them 180 degrees from the way they do now, increase the surface area to pull them out, and please, PLEASE, redesign the case to have the lid flip farther back out of the way so that people with even average- sized fingers can get to these ear buds!","Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2024",AE6VVSQDU46YIRETGGOOQT3EQPDA,TRUE,7,Color: Black

I agree they sound pretty good for the price. They're not Bose, but we're talking ear buds. The Bose that I listened to were almost130 more and the difference wasn't enough to justify the cost. Just a tip, but if you get a little water on your finger and rub it around ear tip it should solve or at least help the problem with a loose tips.

R3CDU9S5XF66XB,B0C1QWWZR4,3.0 out of 5 stars Low-end Offerings,NORMAN GARCIA,3,"Purchased these JBL Tune Buds a few weeks ago as I had misplaced my Javbra 5 Buds and needed a quick and inexpensive replacement.Here are my observations:Fit - I am of average ear size (I think). I tried all three sizes of bud that came with the packaging. The medium size fit best but by best, I mean just adequate. The silicon buds were cheap feeling and lacked any stiffness that might have helped secure them better to my ear and helped/assisted the ANC when turned on.Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) - I live in a metropolitan area that is chronically loud. If you live in a quieter area, these might work for you. For me, the ANC is poor to adequate and I suspect the ill fitting bud plays into this factor.Software - I feel the software is mediocore at best. I use these buds for playing music and for remote meetings via MS TEAMs. Once the TEAMs meeting starts the software deactivates ANC and you are able to hear the ""ambient' sounds from your surrounding environment. I can hear the meeting participants fine but they complain that they have trouble hearing me. They tell me that the barely hear my voice and instead hear the noise around me. Not sure of the logic making this ""auto ANC off"" for meetings a thing with the buds/software. Ultimately, I just listen and don't offer much feedback because it ends up being a distraction.Talk - On individual calls, friends and family hear me fine.Meetings - not recommended for meetings as the software is set to turn off ANC once a meeting begins.Gaming - I feel that young people could use these phones to game if they are in a quiet setting like their room.Price - I feel that these JBL Tune Buds were priced adequately around $50.Final Thoughts - If you are willing to pay $25 more I recommend Jabra 5 buds. Your ears will thank you for it.","Reviewed in the United States December 8, 2023",AFXEN64KEEJBIHRI5VNC3X77ZHQA,TRUE,3,Color: WhiteSize: SmallPattern: Earbuds

R1PM8XR6N66HJO,B0C1QWWZR4,5.0 out of 5 stars Mastering Engineer Approved,Jenn,5,"A lot of pros with one con.I didn‚Äôt think I had a lot of time for earbuds during the day, so I started off trying a cheap pair. They were $20 or something with 4.8 stars and reviews like, ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt used my Airpods since buying these!‚Äù so I thought that sounded perfect.They sucked. The sound was harsh, they became painful after extended use, noise cancelling was barely noticeable, etc. I can‚Äôt actually remember all of the problems at this point. BUT they sold me on the functionality of wireless headphones.Fast-forward to a few months later - it‚Äôs Black Friday and I bite on these because they‚Äôre on sale. I was a little hesitant because they had a lowly 4.2 stars. Turns out average reviews aren‚Äôt everything.These are the polar opposite of the highly-reviewed, cheap headphones I tried: they‚Äôre comfortable, and the sound is amazing. As the title implies, I master audio so this is not a hollow endorsement. The cheap ones had hyped bass, missing mids, and painful presence/treble. These are very flat and well-performing by comparison, and can be EQ‚Äôd. The noise cancelling is also VERY respectable. I frequently work around loud sources and am sensitive to loud noises, and I have accidentally left these in when I intended to swap for earplugs, because the performance is similar.I love the app. Being able to select between audio quality vs. video sync‚Äôing is awesome when I want to watch live musical performances where sync issues play with your mind. Being able to create custom EQ settings is very important to me too.The con is that you have to take them out of the case to power them on. It‚Äôs not a huge deal - it‚Äôs easy to pop them in for a split second if they‚Äôve timed out or something. But there has been one occasion that I ran somewhere and forgot the case. I intend to live my life without dependence on crap like headphones, so no big deal - take a break.I would normally give something like this 4 stars because that power-on function is a notable miscalculation on JBL‚Äôs part, but it deserves a much better average review than it has so I‚Äôm doing my part to raise it. In everyday life it‚Äôs not that big of a deal unless you‚Äôre the kind of person who loves to find things to complain about.","Reviewed in the United States January 12, 2024",AFO7HNFRBAYYCEYUNPA4KKJ3ZWTA,TRUE,104,Color: WhiteSize: SmallPattern: Earbuds

These JBL Tune buds produce a good sound with my iPhone, especially when using the JBL app which has preset equalizer settings for different sounds and can deliver amazing base. Overall these are fairly good earbuds at a sale price of around $50. The box includes 3 pairs of silicon tips, small, medium and large, the silicon material is too smooth and too thin, they slide out easily and do not sit very securely for me, but this is very subjective and can be different for everyone. The noise canceling is only ok, in my opinion it provides about 40-50% background noise cancelation (personal opinion, not scientifically measured). The sound quality is very good but it seems the volume level seems low compared to other buds I have.

I have several pairs of the lesser Vibes, which sound good, but these blow them out of the water.First, let's address the fitment. I see many say they don't fit, they fall out, or feel like they're going to fall out. Don't put the large ear pads on if you don't have large ear canal openings! This will cause the earbuds to push themselves out. Too large will push them out, while too small will obviously not have enough to grip your ear. Test them all to find the right fit, if not, reach out to JBL, I'm sure they have replacement pads of other sizes. You can also buy them here on Amazon as they're pretty universal.I find pushing them in, and turning them into place, with the proper pads, netted a great seal and no falling out.You HAVE to install the app on your phone; otherwise, you're getting the flat sound your phone manufacturer decided sounded good. The JBL app is available for Apple and Android - and it makes a massive difference, especially with the noise cancellation and frequency response.With these, I'm hearing songs I've listened to for decades for the first time. I'm hearing effects and instruments I never heard in the music. These are that clear. They also don't kill my ears! I've tried earbuds from $5 to $300, and while the more expensive ones sounded terrific, they hurt my ears physically. With these, I get great sound and a great fit with a tremendous battery life.I'm reading a lot of negative reviews where either the fit or the sound is the problem. Most of these would be positive if people were provided with either longer pads so they go a bit further into the ear and more sizes and those with sound complaints would actually install the app. Mine sounded horrible with the Dolby equalizer baked into Android 13. Installing the app AND turning off any phone equalizer or sound enhancer was the solution.

This ear bud wants to hang out as far as possible to the edge for me to keep pushing it back in and when I do it hits the touch sensitive surface and does all kinds of stuff.

I did buy one pair last year that was decent, but it had connection problems. So I returned it.I pretty much gave up until I came across this one. The price was too good to pass up. It was delivered not quickly, but within the promised time frame. Given my experience, I have low expectations. But the JBL brand name does give me some hope of acceptable quality.BT Connection was fast and secure with no problems so far. Sound quality is much better than I expected, especially for the price. While the sound stage is not as open as my high-end wired headphones, imagining is excellent, which I did not expect.

Capsule charge was at 75% while both buds were at 100%.Next I tried placing them in my ears. When i placed them in my ears and turn them counterclockwise the weren't very comfortable and felt loose like they were going to fall out, however they did say in place when i tilted my head to either side and shook my head. These earbuds are supplied additional ear cushions. I tried the bigger ones and for my ears these were too big for my ear canal and would not stay in very well. I tried the smaller ones and these wouldn't hold in place. I'd like to say they were like Goldilocks and the 3 bears, but none were just right. The closest for me were the medium size, but I still didn't trust them staying in while doing yard work.Today was the first day I've had to really put them to the test. I place them in and fiddle with them for a bit to get a ""snug"" fit. The only way I could achieve this was by turning them so that the J in the JBL logo was at about a 180 degrees facing upwards.I started Spotify and proceeded to start the yard work. I noticed myself constantly fiddling with the earbud, because the kept feeling like the were going to fall out, enough so that I kept activating the voice pass through.After about a hour and a half into the yard work I was met with a bluetooth disconnected message. When I looked at my phone (Samsung galaxy s23 ultra) it showed bluetooth was enabled and the buds were paired. I started Spotify again and the music resumed. So I was like ok????I did about another 2 hrs of yard work and they stayed connected, but I still constantly felt they were going to fall out.With today's experience, I will not be using these near my poolWould I recommend these to a friend?

I have gotten JBL ear buds in the past (that were tethered and stayed in my ears very comfortably) and the sound quality was excellent at half the price of this pair. Also, I can;t get them to stay in my ears as I walk. They continue to get loose and fall out or if I try to press them back they go on and off repeatedly. It's very irritating. But the quality of sound is terrible. It sounds like an AM radio with no stereo. Not really happy with these at all and feel like I've completely wasted my money.

I twice face the issue and they dropped from about 5'6"" height and survived.Now, the Ambient sound mode is just a trash. Very little or no sounds are hearable from even 5ft distance. Talk through can help in that case, but talk through make the volume lower by default and can't increase at a certain level.ANC works fine at this price range, but a hissing sound is there and sometimes feels annoying while in between songs.

On par with the good sounding off brand $30 sets. Big difference is that they have features that help with ambient sounds and has noise canceling. Thing though is I was very unimpressed with those features after owning a pair of Bose earphones. These were also really lightweight/cheap feeling compared to my Bose, and weren't as easy to use with the taps and stuff. Then there is the fitment issues. Do they have different size rubber pieces? Yes. 3 sizes, 1 set of each. None of them worked, to the point that almost every facial muscle movement or jaw movement caused them to fall out. Personally I like to be able to talk when I'm on a phone call, but these made it hard to. And trying to watch a movie while eating? Impossible! I spent more time catching/picking up my earbud and trying to resume the movie than I did eating.Ultimately my advice is that if you're not wanting to spend a lot of money on features like noise cancelation, take a chance with an off brand for a third of the price and you'll most likely still have the same sound quality. If you want thise features and are willing to pay this price, spend a little more and get Bose or a good brand that knows how to to it right.

IDK if my ears are weirdly-shaped or what, but I tried TOZO NC2s and JLab Go Air Pops which both were incredibly painful. I also tried a friend's Airpods briefly and they also hurt. Finally I spotted a relative's Galaxy Buds 2 and asked to try them and the difference was incredible - these are super comfortable!The sound quality is also incredible compared to all others I've tried, and while I've never really bothered with ANC on other ones I've tried, the noise cancelling on these is certainly good enough for me. I do tend to leave it off to save the battery though, which is the main weak point of these. 5 1/2 hours or so with noise cancelling on isn't great. But I find they block enough noise for me even with it off, which makes the battery life more like 8 hours or a bit over. Even with ANC off, they block enough that I can't hear someone across the room trying to get my attention unless they're really yelling. I often use just one earbud, and I like that you can use either on its own and easily switch between them.I have a Samsung phone, which means the Galaxy Wear app lets you manage these and use the equalizer settings and such. I also love the fast pair with Samsung, where they pop up immediately asking to pair or connect, and I REALLY like the seamless pairing feature that lets me switch them instantly between my phone and my (Windows) computer without have to go into Bluetooth settings and disconnect or unpair from one to pair to the other.Overall, very happy with these. I wasn't sure how much I would really use them, so was hesitant to pay the full retail price, and the first refurbished pair I tried had one earbud that didn't work which made me wary of going that route. So this international version seemed like a nice option. I added an Asurion protection plan just in case, but so far these have worked flawlessly for several months.","Reviewed in the United States November 3, 2022",AHMCTKUXUH5SKEICXIVEEZVTTRSQ,TRUE,16,

Consant dropouts and having to factory reset every other week.Galaxy is so much better. Just plug and play.It might install some type of Galaxy Wearable app but you can just uninstall it. One trick is once you've paired the buds and stow they away. Turn on Phone Bluetooth then pull the buds out of the case, it'll reconnect on it's own and not have to bother with the Galaxy Wearable app screen. Or just double click back button on Android if you pair the regular way.Sound is incredible for $65, it won't knock your socks off but it surpasses it's price point. Also doesn't overwhelm you with bass like most earphones. Loud bass doesn't indicate good quality and I appreciate that Samsung agrees with that. Supposedly ANC only works when both buds are used but I've had luck on a single earbud. Pretty much can't hear noise on my left ear.Be careful using both buds on ANC when walking or crossing. It really does work well, maybe too well.Buds are comfortable even good enough for side sleepers on a firm pillow.Haven't tested the battery properly as I only use it for commute for about an hour. Usually only need to charge the case once every 10 days. ANC will increase drain on the battery if activated.Overall really great buds for $65. Can't complain much and even the annoying app install can be removed or simply backed out by a couple presses of the back button. I've had more annoying earbuds before.

RO46AEMG7IL2Q,B09CKF166Y,5.0 out of 5 stars Truly Impressive!,Trey Brown,5,"Purchased these when they were on sale and was completely blown away!First thing that stood out was the active noise cancellation! Being able to go from noise cancellation to ambient sounds is great, especially for certain situations!If you're in a loud environment and want to listen to music/audio books - noise cancellation! If you want to listen to music but need to be aware of your surroundings and hear people - ambient sounds! The noise cancellation blocks out roughly 80-90% of the total outside sound; its amazing! The ambient sounds option plays back your voice in the earbuds, so that you're not yelling at people next to you, you'll maintain your normal talking voice.As for the quality of sound - they're good! Nothing truly stands out here, but they have a good sound quality and there isn't too much bass/treble.Battery life is good! You'll get several hours of play time before needing to put them back in the case. Out of a full charge on the case, I can go about 2-3 days before needing to charge the case again.My advice to those that purchase - you get much more access to different options and controls if you download the Samsung Wearable app, which gives these earbuds even more appeal! Even if I didn't get these during a sale, they'd still 100% be worth the price!","Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2023",AHT7O3QDGSSBTSFP5S3Z3OR4GVWA,TRUE,3,

RYL1FEY7GIB9C,B09CKF166Y,5.0 out of 5 stars Just like brand new,Micah K,5,"I had a pair of knock-off Galaxy Buds, and the design was similar, but they had no ANC at all (even though the packaging hyped it up--it just didn't exist). The sound quality from them was barely acceptable--I didn't expect much from some cheap knock-offs.I have purchased renewed products before, and I know that sometimes it's a crap-shoot---you may get something that isn't any good. I was willing to take that chance for some decent ear buds.When I got them, they still had a bit of charge, so I was eager to try them. I opened up the case, and my phone (Samsung) immediately detected them and assigned them a name. I put one in my ear and music from Spotify started playing. I got the other one in, and was immediately surprised at the depth and richness of the sound. The knock off pair didn't really have a lot of bass, but these Buds 2 really delivered (compared to the knockoffs).That's not to say that they have an amazing sound, but when you listen to Chinese fakes, the difference is staggering.Battery life is not as long as I would like--I get about 5 hours with ANC on, so it's not terrible, I just wish it was a bit longer---not that I have reason to have them in my ears for longer than that (well, except on plane rides). The case doesn't take too long to top them off, but I haven't tested to see how many charges I can get out of the case.They are comfortable enough to sleep with them in my ears. I have taken a few naps with them in my ears listening to some soft music and the ANC on, and have not been awakened by the neighbor's dogs--they are worth the price for that alone.I've very satisfied with this purchase.","Reviewed in the United States August 13, 2023",AG7NU5374FXD43ZNLSQ6ZK2EOLXQ,TRUE,23,

Then, when I connect it to my phone, when I try to connect to my laptop, it doesn't allow both connections like higher end headphones. So, when I am already connected to my 1st device, to get connected to my 2nd device, I have to manually connect to the 2nd device, then it would disconnect from the first device and switch to the 2nd. I found this a bit uncomfortable. Like for comparison, my sony Headphone can connect two devices at the same time without disconnecting the other, so I wish it had that feature.Other than that, I found the touch sensors a bit sensitive. When I try to adjust my earphones, it would always recognize the touch and would stop the music or the video I was watching. So that is a bit uncomfortable.

I'll update this as time passes and I use them more.2 month update: original review remains true, but I also need to add that the battery life is awesome! Even with ANC maxed and moderate volume I still get like 4 hours of music before they die.Pros:- Immediately comfortable. I tend to sleep in my earbuds and these are low enough profile to continue doing that.- Sound isolation works... alright. Moderate conversation in the same room will occasionally make it through, but it's definitely making a difference. The noise passthrough is actually more helpful to me, as I like to be aware of what's going on. It's easy to switch between the two as well, depending on my surroundings.- Really like the case. Very tactile.Cons:Man, the sound quality is underwhelming. I've got a handful of songs I test new audio stuff on and this made each one sound *really* muddy, with the exception of vocals which are actually really crisp. When I put my computer headphones back on, it was night and day different. I get that they had to pack a lot into a really small package, but music is the *one* thing I expect these to do well, especially at the price they're asking for it.Conclusion:Its fine.

After weeks of rigerous use and while working (delivering for Amazon), I have a solid opinion on this product.I wanted to be able to listen to music and talk on the phone while on the go or at work but isn't really possible with wired earphones. These Galaxy Buds 2 are a great option but definitely not perfect.The sound quality of the buds 2 are great but if you don't keep them clean, the sound quality goes down. The battery life of the buds and case are quite impressive. I use only 1 bud at a time which each lasts me about 4 hours while the case can last about 16 hours on a full charge. The ambient and noise canceling features are great too but the ambient sound feature can get too noisy if it's windy or a lot of stuff going on in the background. The phone quality is good but sometimes the person I'm on call with has trouble hearing me if I'm moving around or there's too much background sound (which is usually the case while I'm delivering) but still works okay so don't expect the best quality with phone calls. I also love the wireless charging feature.Overall this has been one of my best purchases of the year as I definitely have gotten my money's worth and enjoyment out of this product.

R28UUNYH1FNQ2,B09CKF166Y,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent sound. Nifty bells and whistles that shorten battery life. User friendliness is iffy,Z.K.,5,"The earbuds overall are wonderful. The sound is crisp and clear. I was hesitant after seeing some reviews mentioning discomfort and the earbuds easily falling out. I've used these all day every workday for seventeen days. I've fallen asleep with these things in my ears at night. I can say that I've had no issues with these things falling out. Quite the contrary. With the larger bud tips (don't remember the exact name for 'em) these earbuds have stayed in my ears without issue. In fact, I'd say, when it comes to staying in, these earbuds are more reliable than any other earbuds I've had. They've stayed in through walking, running, exercise, tossing and turning in my sleep, you name it!Now these earbuds do have a few bells and whistles that eat into the battery life. Of all the earbuds I've had, these ones definitely have the worst battery life. However, that's not really saying much. The extensive battery lives of most wireless earbuds have set that bar very high. And while these particular earbuds didn't quite clear that bar, the battery life is still more than adequate for me. I've never had issues with these things running out of juice on me. After four hours of near consistent use without recharging, the battery was still at 54 percent.In any case, the tradeoff is worth it for me. I'm loving the active noise cancellation as well as the ambient sound mode. It's so nice to be able to listen to someone without having to take out one earbud and hold it in your hand. Incidentally, I realized I could use ambient sound mode to filter out annoying sounds while listening to someone. For example, with ambient sound at medium volume, I could hear the voices of my peers just fine, but I didn't hear the annoying hum of florescent lights.The earbuds may not be the most user friendly. There aren't really instructions that come with it. Just a QR code directing you to download the app. The app will then instruct you on how to use these. You do need to download the app to get these things working. It did trip me up at the beginning but once I figured it out, I actually grew to like the app. The app lets you control the ambient noise volume, locate your earbuds if you misplace them, and disable touch controls so you don't accidentally pause or play whatever you're listening to. There is an app available for windows computers (don't know about macs). I use these on my pc as well as my android phone.All in all, I'm happy with my purchase. If you don't mind trading off some battery life for some nifty features, and don't mind having to add an app to your phone to get your earbuds going, then I would highly recommend these","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2024",AF7ZTPONFIT4PSGOJF4TCVDID3LQ,TRUE,1,
R8ZQW2Z4EPQ3X,B09CKF166Y,"5.0 out of 5 stars Best Earbuds I've used, with some downsides",A,5,"These are the best earbuds I've used so far. I used a set of akg n400's before, but they were way too uncomfortable, fell out too easily, and battery life sucked. That could just be me and the fact I didn't have the other silicone ear triangle things. Not sure these sound as good as the n400's, but they sound very good.Sound:I like good audio, but I really don't have a great ear for judging quality. That said, these sound great to me. They sound very similiar to the AKG N400's perhaps with less bass.Fit:The buds2 fit in my ear very nicely with the included tips and I can wear them for around 9hrs without issues. They do fall out occasionall, but it's usually easy to feel when they're falling out and adjust them.Battery:The battery life on these is very impressive, as they often last 6-9hrs without charging in the case. For some reason the earbuds often drain their batteries unevenly, so you'll end up with one dead and one with 20-30% charge still. The case battery is very good and I've never ran it empty before.Case:Honestly, the case is probably my biggest issue with these earbuds. Any light drop and the case will shoot out the tiny earbuds in a 360, and then the case will close itself. This makes it really easy to lose the earbuds and not notice because the case closed itself back up.Buttons: It took me a few weeks of using the earbuds to appreciate the touch controls. Now it works fairly reliably. The app also gives you a lot of controls for the buttons.Noise Cancellation/Ambient Sound: Noise cancelling is pretty good. Not amazing but good. Some static is audible when using it. Ambient sound is okayish. It picks up on a lot of unwanted background noises like fan noise and doesn't pick up on people's speech well. Both of these features are made worse by what I talk about below.Other issues. Perhaps the most annoying issue is the earbuds have some sensor that detects if the earbud is in your ear. If it detects one earbud is not in your ear, it will disable noise cancelling or ambient sound until it detects them in your ear again. It's a great idea but it malfunctions all the time if the earbuds aren't perfectly seated in your ear. Meaning you'll be adjusting them a lot if you use noise cancelling or ambient sound. The app seriously some spyware. I've never seen any app ask for more permissions and it won't open if you deny most of them. I recommend you have some way to trick the app to deny permissions if you care about privacy. The main permissions you want to deny is location or it's ability to connect to the internet if your phone can do that, unless you need its find my earbuds ability. Otherwise the app is pretty useful and leagues better than the AKG app.","Reviewed in the United States January 1, 2024",AGOIIK7TZKYXIXUTFLB5ITI33KVQ,TRUE,39,
R11G7P0P9ECVA3,B09CKF166Y,"5.0 out of 5 stars Samsung strikes again! Quality, affordable, Bluetooth earbuds.",Alex Gonzalez,5,"The Galaxy Buds 2 are good quality Bluetooth earbuds. Having owned the Galaxy Buds+ originally, these were a decent upgrade in some regards and a downgrade in others.**Comfort**Probably the most important aspect of earbuds for some people is the comfort quality. The earbuds include 3 different size ear tips to help you find the right fit. Additionally, in the Galaxy Wearable app, there is a feature to actually test the fit. This is helpful as you can tinker and find the right earbud tip combinations for you. Prolonged sessions did result in some ear fatigue for me and I found the tips becoming a bit loose with excessive movement. I would probably not wear these to work out in. My aforementioned Galaxy Buds+ have wingtips on the top that help them remain securely in place, I find them to be a bit more comfortable than these.**Battery Life**Battery life on the Galaxy Buds 2 appear to be as advertised. For my use they are perfect as I do not wear my buds for long periods of time and am able to charge them in between sessions easily. The included charging case is easy to use and I can snap the buds in with no issues. Again, the Galaxy Buds+ were a bit better in this regard with the battery lasting around 9 hours on one charge, but they also did not have Active Noise Cancellation which consumes a good amount of battery life.**Connectivity**Using a Galaxy phone makes connecting these headphones a breeze! It was a simple as opening the case. Seriously, once I did that my phone recognized it and had a popup to pair. Connecting them to my tablet (S8) was not as easy. I had to put the earbuds into pairing mode and open my Galaxy Wearable app on the tablet and connect that way. Once set up, it is very easy to reconnect. I also was able to pair with my Chromecast for late night TV viewing without waking up my wife.**Audio**This is where this set of earbuds earns its keep in my opinion. I am by NO MEANS an audiophile but the audio quality coming from the Buds+ was night and day for me. Music, TV, and calls all sound clear and crisp with a decent amount of bass without virtually 0 static. The ambient noise and active noise cancellation features work as intended and the 360 audio is a very cool feature to add a level of immersion, especially when watching movies.**Conclusion**This is a solid set of earbuds and at the current price point, makes a ton of sense in my opinion. I am very pleased with this set and will continue to use them as my ""daily driver"" earbuds.","Reviewed in the United States April 17, 2023",AFVYZYEI7QC7DKERB6XEIDIATLFA,TRUE,106,

Overall great sound quality, no complaints really, and there is a eq app that allows you to customize the sound to your preference. Whether that be if you like more bass or a soft listening experience.2. Comfort is good on these earbuds, genuinely some of the most comfortable earbuds out there. And they come with different sized ear pieces. But comfort is subjective so your mileage may vary.3. Battery life is great, I very rarely need to charge them. You can definitely get 6 hours out of them on a full charge. And the case can store an additional 15 hours. It takes 15 min to charge the earbuds to full and 2 hours to charge the case to full.Cons:1. Noise cancelation is not great. Don't be expecting to jump on a plane and drown out the engine, talking, and inevitable crying baby. The anc is like a 4/102. If you don't have a samsung phone it will not be as seamless of an experience. Meaning widgets won't display battery percentage, you also won't get a pop up when connected telling you battery percentage. You won't be able to change eq settings either since the app you need is only on samsung devices. So my advice is to get the respected earbuds that pair with your phone. So, if you have a iPhone, get airpods. If you have a pixel, get pixel buds. Etc.3. Minor nit-pick but sometimes my earbuds will randomly disconnect, so I will have to put them back in the case and then put them back in my ears.4. The touch controls aren't very good. They aren't very responsive, So don't bother with them.Overall they are extremely good earbuds for the price. They are a great budget option for wireless earbuds that will surely not disappoint.

I would have never I have purchased them myself, as spending top dollar for a pair of earbuds or headphones to me was not something that I would have spit my money on. I had no instructions, just a little black case in the bottom of a drawer, that someone had left behind. What I discovered, was a piece of technology, that made my life better, and it's quality, simplicity, and joy that it bestowed upon my soul.I only had that unit for a period of maybe 2 months. During that time I use them to live. The full sound l, flawless amplification of surrounding noises, everything about these was amazing. The fit in my ear, the simplicity of touch controls, everything made them something I didn't know that I couldn't live without. Through sheer negligence, I I dropped the right bud into a toilet, and flust it before I realized what had happened. There was a period of grief. And that left bud sat in its case and a drawer for 4 months, as I did not have the disposable funds to go buy a new pair, until it occurred to me to just buy a replacement for the lost bud. Purchase of the second hand market I could never get it to pair and it just sent me further into sadness.Set that time I have made an emission, define a worthy replacement. I have spent conservatively $1,800 and tried every brand from generic to Apple to the Samsung's themselves come and nothing matched the pure perfection of the plus. Well what are you going to do they don't make them anymore. And then on prime I saw that Samsung was selling them, for more then they're top of the line current model. How's this possible? They quit selling them years ago?My theory is that the human ear, Is only so big. There was a team at Samsung that put this bud into the Universe, and those in the upper echelon know it is the Alpha qnd Omaga. I planned up the lessons, and the perfect bargain earbud does not make for the quarterly Prophets jump where the marketing team happy. So they have hidden this, for those that are only in the know. Hey now you know, I bought and Amazon refurbished pair, as well as the buds FE. As a birthday present. The buds FE arrived 3 days before the plus, and I did not unseal the package, because I knew in my heart. I went to my Amazon locker 3 days later with speed and haste that not felts in years. Went home and let them sit for a good I don't know hour and a half as I twittered about my apartment. And when I put them in my ear? Yeah, that's the stuff. Look no further.

As someone who is always on the go and constantly listening to music or podcasts, having a reliable and comfortable pair of earbuds is essential for me. The Galaxy Buds FE have exceeded my expectations in both of these areas.First and foremost, the comfort and secure fit of these earbuds is top-notch. The wing-tip design ensures that they stay in place even during intense workouts or when I'm running errands. I have tried many other wireless earbuds in the past and have always struggled with finding a pair that stays in my ears comfortably. The Galaxy Buds FE have solved this problem for me and I can wear them for hours without any discomfort.The sound quality of these earbuds is also impressive. The audio is clear and crisp, with a good balance of bass and treble. I have used them for both music and phone calls and have been pleased with the sound in both scenarios. The touch controls on the earbuds are also very convenient and easy to use. I can easily pause or skip a song without having to take out my phone.One of the standout features of these earbuds is the auto switch audio. This allows me to seamlessly switch between my phone and laptop when I receive a call or want to listen to something on my computer. It's a small feature, but it has made a big difference in my daily routine.I also appreciate the built-in voice assistant feature. I can easily access my virtual assistant with just a touch of the earbud, making it convenient to make calls, send texts, or get directions without having to take out my phone.The battery life on these earbuds is also impressive. I can use them for several hours without needing to recharge, and the charging case provides additional battery life when I'm on the go. The case is also compact and easy to carry around.Overall, I highly recommend the SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds FE True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds.

There are a lot of different options to customize what that does in the app.-Sound quality is great.-The fit is fantastic for me. I love the ear ""wings"". They make a nice secure fit that and it never feels like they are in danger of falling out.-Changing case is compact and these charge easily by dropping them in.-There is an option to set either the right or left earbud to toggle between noise canceling and ambient sound modes when you long press. Both these modes work great. Noise canceling is enough that I can mow the lawn without needing separate ear protection and I can quickly switch to ambient mode if I need to hear someone talking to me.-The biggest upside is that these are quite a bargain.

If you have questions about these topics please read!I purchased these for my boyfriend. He has a Samsung S22. I have bought him multiple types of brand new earbuds in the $70-$80 range in the past. He had to charge all those daily in order to used for 1.5 hrs while he walked. I wanted to buy him something nicer so I bought these. I chose to buy a used set in hopes that they were in great condition and maybe the box was just torn. I changed them overnight on accident (I prefer not to charge too long). Then paired then with my iPhone. I have owned several versions and pairs of iPods and Beats Pro (over the ear). So my first reaction was disappointment because the sound quality did not compare and little things didn‚Äôt work the same. For example when you take your Beats out if your ear whatever your watching stops. That is not the case with these. Also when a call comes in, I had to manually change the option to the ear bud on my phone screen vs just answering by touching my ear. However, I still gave them to my boyfriend for Easter and when he paired them with his galaxy he was prompted to add an extra app that gave him different features than I had with my Apple. Initially he was not too impressed with the sound, he expected them to be louder. The noise canceling was so good, he had to take them out to hear me talk to him. What he loved about them was the length of time he was able to go before charging the case. Remember I charged them one time, then he used them off of my original charge after sitting in the box for a few days. He wore them everyday for 5 days without charging the case. At that point he was really happy with them. Enough to overlook the sound quality since it was not what he expected. Unfortunately when he charged the case he was not able to get the Right earbud to charge. We tried different troubleshooting methods. Unfortunately none of them have worked. We will be sending them back. I don‚Äôt have experience using Apple headphones or buds with Samsung phones but I feel if I had bought these brand new, he would keep them vs buying headphones like mine. I‚Äôd rather pay an extra $50 to get new products going forward. Please air on the side of caution if you buy used or refurbished version of these ear buds. Hopefully this helps someone trying to decide between new or used and Apple/Beats products vs Other earbuds to pair with an android phone.","Reviewed in the United States April 11, 2024",AGJMX2SCRHKROIKHLJLZZB64452A,TRUE,2,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds FE Only

If I take these to the office, I end up accidentally eavesdropping what my coworkers are talking about from a mile away, which ends up been distracting.

The sound quality is great, although I don't have much to compare to because these are the only ones that I have been able to get into my ears and stay for more than 5 minutes. I am so happy I have found something that fits my ears that isn't a $500 + pair of custom molded earbuds.","Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2024",AFAU2IZOQTOHAMRQTQ3U745J7MNQ,TRUE,0,Color: WhiteStyle: Buds FE Only

R2J5F63E48VZCU,B0CF7GYNW2,3.0 out of 5 stars Not overly impressed,Amazon Cutstomer,3,"I've only had these a day but there are not many reviews so I'll give my 1st impressions. I wore them for a few hours doing yard work (using my Samsung S22) and tried them with some of my favorite test tracks connected to my PC and using Amazon HD music (using Exclusive mode)The first thing that surprised me was the white case... I ordered black, and at first thought they sent the wrong ones but opened the case and the buds themselves were black. I don't like white, but whatever.Looking at the case there is not much indication of what is the front and it's a bit fiddly to open. The magnet to suck the buds into place is not very strong, so a bit fiddly to lay them in the case.I don't like wearing buds much, but these were pretty comfortable right out of the box. The insertion was not quite as deep as I like but they stayed in well while I was moving around and I did not feel the need to keep adjusting them.How do they sound:I want to emphasize these are first impressions.These have a polite sound that would probably please many people. I'm not one of them. When I got the Lypertek buds for the same price I told people ""I can't believe how good a sound you can get for $100 these days"". With these, I would say ""They are ok, most people would like them"".They are ""fine"" for having something playing in your ear while you do something else but they did not bring out any joy in the music for me. Nothing stood out about the sound. Ordinary comes to mind or, nothing wrong but nothing right. I'm not into 'soundstage' the the lack of one while listening to live tracks actually stood out to me.The sound is a bit congested, the instruments kind of bunched into each other. There is no 'air' around the instruments. I found myself pushing the volume louder than I normally listen to ""wake them up a bit"".Detail retrieval is decent, but you are not going to notice the reverb, the grind of a distorted guitar, the 'ting' of the drumsticks on a cymbal, breath sounds, etc. The overall presentation is smooth enough from low to high, with no glaring holes, or peaks. If I had to fault the frequency response it would be male voices. Just a bit in your face at times. Bass get a bit tubby if you try to push it much. In ""normal"" mode I found it just about right.Let's see what I can 'fix' with EQ. The EQ in the App has 9 bands, cool! But that hardly matters if there is no custom EQ option. Seriously Samsung? The Sennheiser App only has 3 bands but at least they let you set a custom EQ, name it, and save it.There are 7 presets, but none of them really gave me something I liked. But there is enough variety that most people would find something they like.I'm mixed on keeping them. The sound is good enough for what I want them for. listening to music while I do something else. They are comfortable and stay in well, but I am not impressed with the sound. It's ""fine"", it's ""okay"", and ""good enough"" but not impressed with the sound for the $100 price point.","Reviewed in the United States October 21, 2023",AHEC6HVESDBP2W2DMMSYGA4GPGFA,TRUE,40,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds FE Only

Has an ambient noise feature that I like. The case is magnetic so it's easy to put the buds back in; however, I've dropped the case twice (three foot fall onto carpeted floor) and both times both earbuds fell out which is concerning. Battery life is decent and I have yet to have them die on me. My longest session with them in was about 4 hours. Additional features like tapping to pause media can be a bit finicky and there's been an instance where the buds didn't recognize I was wearing them, so I had to put them back in the case and put them in again to make the right bud turn on.Minus one star because if I wear these for more than 2-3 hours (like when listening to audiobooks) my ears start to hurt.","Reviewed in the United States March 12, 2024",AEPLLLHZ7SUUJNUBJUU7QATOL77A,TRUE,9,Color: WhiteStyle: Buds FE Only

R3RE1QI7DDJ44X,B08ZR5JB9G,4.0 out of 5 stars Good BT earbuds,Photographer,4,"I generally prefer over the ear headphones, but I use earbuds only when I am exercising or doing yardwork. I bought a pair of name brand earbuds that was on sale during BF. Long story short, I had to return it because the sound quality was unacceptable.Rather than trying to find a diamond in haystack so to speak, I picked Sennheiser as it is a brand that I have good experience with. Furthermore, I opted for a higher price point than the rock bottom price I was hoping for.I forgo noise cancelling since I don't need it most of the time. Sonically, this pair of earbuds is very good, bearing typical Sennheiser sound of open and balance. It is still no match for my over the ear headphones, but it is also significantly cheaper. Sound quality is by far the most important aspect, other features are distant seconds and thirds.BT connectivity is, however, not Sennheiser's strength. It took some work to get it connected to all of my devices; I have a pair of Sennheiser over the ear BT headphone that behaves similarly. All of my cheaper BT earbuds have no BT connectivity issues. This weakness is not a showstopper.","Reviewed in the United States November 27, 2023",AES7SSQNH3WNT4EAPENHZ67TRHBQ,TRUE,1,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone
RBEOQ98PJ3836,B08ZR5JB9G,4.0 out of 5 stars Sennheiser knows headphones,Baron,4,"I had some Klipsch ear pods I had to return. Sure they had the metal case and metallic earbuds and all those sizes earbud tips but internal quality was bad a constant buzzing sound from a bad chip so I ordered a second pair still bad so returned both of them. I started think what headphones do I she that just simply worked no gimmicks no flash just pure bonafide Hi-Fi then j realized Sennheiser of course. When I bought these they had just come out no Amazon reviews but I took the chance cause I love my HD-25s and I haven‚Äôt looked back. I‚Äôm an engineer a job that requires focus by my office is smack dab in the middle of a factory floor full of loud noise forklifts , bulldozers firing up for test, people grinding metal , all of that on top of the normal office chatter and these headphones cut right through that while I work at my desk and get work done.Now yes these are 100% plastic but they don‚Äôt feel cheap and that plastic also means they don‚Äôt feel cold touching your skinYes they use standard ear bud tips which I was apprehensive about cause I‚Äôve had issue with those falling off or coming off in my ear but these are designed with an aggressive ridge to keep the tips attached to the headphone.No wireless charging but who cares it‚Äôs USB-C just plug it in at night and go about your day they last all my work dayAnd the sound is probably as good as it gets from reasonably priced Bluetooth earbuds so yeah no bass boomy but that‚Äôs inherent in the form factor bass requires big drivers and lots of power which kills your battery life and adds weight.Could you get better sound sure but why it‚Äôs Bluetooth off your phone into tiny battery powered earbuds so your quality is limited already so this is probably that sweet spot where diminishing marginal returns kicks in where you have to spend way more money or buy big Bluetooth headphones to get better soundIf you buy these as earbuds for work or travel where portability and battery life trumps fidelity then you‚Äôll love these if you expect fidelity similar to much pricier wired headphones you‚Äôll be disappointed but only because your expectations were unrealistic.0","Reviewed in the United States November 16, 2021",AFV7ZI225WCIGLKBRRZGPKITFUKQ,TRUE,9,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone
R167YMGKLUDYU2,B08ZR5JB9G,4.0 out of 5 stars Comprehensive rating: Sennheiser puts sound first (as usual),Scott Herron,4,"After years of using cheap-o headphones and dealing with cable noise, listening to music with the headphones feels like i'm hearing each song for the very first time. I'm hearing details in songs I never heard before, it honestly made me tear up. Incredibly clarity, customizable EQ, AMAZING sound for 100$. You could easily get something with comparable sound that costs twice as much. The sound is why I bought these. Sennheiser is a sound-focused brand. However, there are some places where these headphones cut corners that would not be a problem if you bought 200$+ dollar headphones.Security: I'm a dancer, and I want my headphones to stay on while I'm working in the studio. However, the earbuds aren't the most secure in my ears. They fly out during chain√©e turns, sometimes even just as I'm walking they'll fall out.Comfort: Not the most comfortable for hours of listening. After 2-3 hours of extended use, my ears ached. Changing up the plastic tips didn't help.Noise cancelling: I heard the ANC takes the edge off the sound quality, which is why I bought these and not the active noise cancelling ones. You can definitely tell. I can hear each step I take as I walk thudding in my ears. It's a little odd.Delay: I've tried to use these to watch tiktoks on my phone, and I've noticed a delay in the screen and the sound. I can see the person on my screen moving their mouth, but the words come out into my headphones a little later. It's not the worst, but it's noticeable.Overall: Great for audiophiles on a budget. The app allows you to customize, so there's something to love for everyone, whether you love a sparkling, bright treble or you're a total basshead. For sitting down and listening while you're at your computer, these are an excellent choice. If you're mainly wearing these for working out, maybe something else would suit your needs better. I do equal parts both, which is why I like these a lot. mp3 files can massacre the music quality, and bad headphones can make the sound even muddier. These are an excellent buy. I've had them for about a month, will update if something changes or I have issues.","Reviewed in the United States February 14, 2022",AEMZ3AH6ZAOKKCAPU6IMERPH7HRQ,TRUE,5,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone

R1HOIBXMUJ3YZ4,B08ZR5JB9G,"3.0 out of 5 stars Sound is good, shape is awkward",Jennifer C.,3,"These earbuds have a really good sound. And I love that there is an equalizer in the app so you can adjust it to sound the way you want it. They offer a lot of cool features that apparently not all earbuds have. You can change what the different taps do, but they are capable of answering your phone, raising and lowering the volume, fast forwarding, rewinding, or skipping tracks of songs, pausing and playing - all just buy tapping on the earbuds. Even though it is not one of their advertised features, they also do a very good job of noise canceling as long as they fit in your ear properly.So here's the downside that I found... These earbuds are large and square. Most ears are pretty round. I realize that all ears are shaped differently, but I have a hard time believing that these fit comfortably in most ears. If you're just sitting still at your desk or in the car, it's not too bad. But if you smile really big, they come loose, and If you lean over, they fall out of your ear entirely. When the Stem is seated properly in your ear, The big square part rubs uncomfortably against the outer ear. For this reason alone I am debating whether to return these, or Just suffer with it since I mostly use them in the car or at work. These could be great earbuds if they were more organomically designed.One last note - I don't have a lot to compare it to. But they advertise that the battery life is superior on these, and i'm not convinced. Now I admit I had them running for most of an 8 hour workday. But I had to switch between the left ear and the right ear while one of them was charging in the case, i'd use the other one. So from my experience, I could not run both of them for 6 or 8 hours continuously.","Reviewed in the United States July 28, 2023",AEGNAFTHCFQMCNABBLNIN3IRRHEA,TRUE,4,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone

I have had pretty shoddy luck with headphones, but I had heard good things about this brand, so I thought I‚Äôd give them a go. Their sound is overall above average from what I‚Äôve listened to. They‚Äôre not super bassy like the Beats and Raycons I‚Äôve had, which in some ways are better. I think a lot of people‚Äôs problems with these is that they aren‚Äôt proper Audiophile material like some of Sennheiser‚Äôs other products, but if you‚Äôre looking for wireless buds, you probably aren‚Äôt really looking for the greatest sound on the market.I like the software that these use. The app lets you tweak the bass, mids and highs a bit so you can get get the sound a bit more to your liking. It also lets you switch between sources more easily than some other Bluetooth headphones.I will say that these aren‚Äôt the most ergonomic earbuds ever, they fit just fine normally, but if you try to sleep with them, or put any pressure on your ear with a hat or something, they really dig into your ears, but that‚Äôs a non issue to most people.The noise cancellation is decent, but I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs not any tech behind it like with the AirPods, I think these just plug up your ears so you don‚Äôt hear the outside noise, and they do that pretty well.The case is pretty good too.

R2DX8KHP8703FK,B08ZR5JB9G,2.0 out of 5 stars This one doesn't live up to the Sennheiser name,Nicky,2,"I had a Sennheiser full over-the-ear headphones some years ago and was satisfied with it. I bought this one on Black Friday and have been using it for several days. I now have three pairs of earbuds: Apple AirPods, SkullCandy and this one, which took me the most time to pair and connect.1) The small paper guide conveniently didn't mention that a small film on the mental contact must be peeled off. The charging case showed green light after a couple hours charging but I couldn't get them to connect. It was only after researching the questions section that I learned about this step (so apparently others were confused too).2) The shape of the earbuds make it difficult to grab and pull them out of the charging case. Each time it takes more than one try.3) No indicator light on the front of earbuds themselves to show the battery level. My SkullCandy (much cheaper but equally good sound quality) has indicator light on the earbuds. It would become red to tell me to put it back in the charging case.4) To connect to a device for the first time is confusing. A YouTube clip tells me to watch the little light in the back to blink red/blue to indicate it's ready to pair/connect. But when I tried to connect with a second device (after disconnecting from the first one), it didn't blink. The guide shows to put fingers on the earbuds (after inserting into the ears) to put it in paring mode. The SkullCandy doesn't require any additional step: after the earbuds are taken out of the case, a voice tells you that it's ready to connect.5) It won't let you switch from one device to another easily. When I turn off the Bluetooth on my iPad and tried to switch to my cellphone (with earbuds still in my ears), I can't connect right away. I wound up having to put them back in the case and then take them out to connect to the second device (unlike SkullCandy, which stays in pairing mode and lets you connect to the 2nd device right away).All in all, It's not worth the value compared to a cheaper but better product like SkullCandy.Added 12/27/2022: Now that I‚Äôve used for more than three weeks (bought on Black Friday), I should downgrade the rating from my initial 3 stars to 2 stars. I finally managed to connect it with my laptop after several attempts but it seemed random and I still don‚Äôt know how it happened. And it happened several times that one of the earbuds would lose sound for no apparent reason while I was using them. I would need to take them out of my ears, put them back into the case, took them out to reconnect again. Or sometimes only one earbud got connected with the device after taking both out of the charging case. I would not buy it again.","Reviewed in the United States December 1, 2022",AGUCYTK4WI5QN4KWJ7K43QZ6LSKQ,TRUE,5,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone

When they were brand new on the market they cost a lot more. A lot of news channel interviews are with guests not in the studio. They're at their home or office so the sound is of poor quality. I listen to a lot of news in Spanish so with the other factors mentioned it's hard for me to understand. Sometimes there will even be a music overlay which really makes it hard for me to understand.

Connection problem.Eventually most earbuds will start disconnecting from my phone, ToZo, ILuv, Senheiserner, ect ect...These earbuds are no exception.Now for the first two weeks these earbuds were perfect, they had great sound, great connectivity, the app worked without issue.But after week two, they started not connecting to my phone, sometimes they would cut out randomly, and I had to restart them. For cheap earbuds, this is expected. Not for $100 pair. However I had bought so many, I was tired of it and gave these the benefit of the doubt.Here I am a month and a half later and the issue alas only gotten worse. I don't know if it's Senheiserners fault, or the particular pair I got, but either way I couldn't put up with it any longer, thankfully Amazon offered me a full refund, and I intend on buying the ""Google Pixel Buds A-Series"" (the ones I was originally going to get)I really wanted these earbuds to work, and I took perfect care of them. I didn't let them over charge, I never dropped them or tossed them once. So I know for a fact that fault wasn't mine own atleast.If you want good earbuds of a similar price, I dunno, this is the most expensive pair I've owned.If you want good earbuds of a cheaper price try the Mpow M30 Plus, I've had that pair for almost two years and they have failed me only twice in all that time (and it was my fault). Or maybe I genuinely just got a bad pair, I don't know. I know when these earbuds worked, they were excellent.I have had great experiences with Senheiser in the past, this is the first time they've let me down.Hopefully this is the last negative Earbud review I ever have to make, we'll see Goggle Pixel Buds A-Series, I'm coming for you next, don't fail me too.","Reviewed in the United States May 7, 2022",AFHOTNY7QTDBDCLJRYRG2OVX3S4Q,TRUE,2,Color: WhiteSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone

I usually have on a single bud while using and that works fine for both listening to music and calling. The battery life is fantastic. I get better mileage out of it compared to the Galaxy buds. Personally I think these are more comfortable than the Galaxy buds and the sound quality is superior to the Galaxy buds. That might not be the case for everyone. The Sennheiser CX is a bit bulky, so angling and fit I could see not working out for everyone. They are snug for me and generally a great fit, however I have had an instance of it falling off once or twice.

Was looking for something equally as good but for a bit cheaper. Stumbled across these and looked at some reviews. Flossy Carter's review is what gave me the go ahead, but boy was he wrong on this one.These are extremely cheaply made (case and earbuds feel horrible to the touch), the earbuds are uncomfortable to wear for more than 30 minutes, the sounds quality is nothing as you'd expect from Sennheiser. And the horrid app is nearly unusable.Normally I'd excuse the sound quality when you can set your own equalizer, but the app to do that doesn't work half the time. When you launch it, it just flat out doesn't connect to the earbuds. It will show them for a second but then say connection failed. If you get pass this, the app is extremely slow and buggy. Even if the app worked, the equalizer only includes bass, mids, and highs so you can't fully customize it to your liking.For some good points about these earbuds. They are lightweight and don't move around easily in your ear. The magnets to secure the earbuds and close the case feel great. The touch controls are very responsive. The sound queues and tones are clear and easy to understand. And the battery life is good + it charges quickly.So give these earbuds a pass and go with the JBL Live 300's. Much better sound quality, and an app that works. They are $150 retail but frequently go on sale for $100 (I got them for $75 on amazon). You'll also be getting auto play/pause, and a slightly better water resistance rating at IPX5.","Reviewed in the United States August 24, 2021",AFL7DAIS7RHT23VDIZF4BZKBABWQ,TRUE,44,Color: WhiteSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone

I think most of us do, at least anyone looking into something like Sennheiser.That being said, I usually go to Bose, because they have fantastic sound, and, they are the most comfortable for me. The wingtips really help keep them in my ears, and since they're soft silicone, it's comfortable.I typically don't like in ears with this design. They annoy my ears to the point that I just can't wear them for more than an hour. These on the other hand are actually quite comfortable. They aren't the most comfortable thing on the planet, but I find myself able to wear them for hours at a time without feeling any fatigue.The noise canceling does leave a little to be desired, but it's definitely present. It doesn't suck the world out like a nice pair of over ears or a really, really nice sent of ANC in ears. But, for the price point, they weren't so far away from things double, or even almost triple the price. They're great.The best thing about these earbuds, though, is their sound quality. They sound absolutely fantastic. Now, if you're a basshead, they probably aren't quite for you. But if you want to hear the nice boomy bass, punchy kids, and sparkly highs; these are fantastic. You can hear the low end a bit better with the bass boost profile, you can even EQ them in app to your preferences. But for me, the take home with these was the solid sound signature. I could hear all of the lower undertones of sound work in the high end, while getting a nice clear sounding low end. Again, if you're really looking for that low end - low kids punch, these probably won't do it for you. But if you want all aspects of your song to stand out equally, these are great.At this price, if you're thinking about getting them. I say go for it.

I tested it with different types of music (rock, hip-hop, spanish, etc), as well as some podcasts. While the sound quality across the board is good, it didn't outperform a $50 pair of Enacfire E90 earbuds I had before they stopped working. When it comes to bass, the old E90's actually did BETTER than these. The comfort is decent, and aren't heavy enough to fall off your ears. Unfortunately, I can't say anything about the battery life since these STOPPED working less than 24 hours after they were delivered!Oh and about the failure, I mainly blame their (stupid) ""Smart Control"" app for this. Like I said before, the earbuds worked fine and paired quicky...until I used this dumpster fire of an app. At first, I was able to link the earbuds with the app and then I tried to update the firmware since it was available. Big, BIG MISTAKE. Even though the earbuds were (supposedly) at 90% battery and were recently charged with a fully charged case, I was instructed to put them them back into the case in order to start the update. After doing so and waiting an hour, the earbuds have refused to go into Bluetooth pairing mode.***UPDATE 08/22/2021***After contacting Sennheiser support via email, they suggested that I get a replacement pair, which is what I did. After getting them, I have to say, I now LOVE these earbuds! I don't know why, but this pair sounds a LOT better than the first ones I got. I can now safely say thay sound better than anything else I've tried, including my old E90's. Pairing was simple and fast, using a single earbud was effortless, and the range is fantastic.While I didn't get the 9 hrs of battery life that was advertised, the most I've gotten so far is about 7.5 hrs, which is still great for true wireless earbuds. Regardless of what you listen to, these earbuds sound amazing and have a great amount of bass. While a few have said that these are too heavy for their ears, it wasn't the case for me. I work in a warehouse where I'm constantly on the move, and I NEVER experienced a moment where I felt like these were going to fall off. That being said, I stand by my previous comment where I say that these won't fall off your ears, even if you're moving around. These are rated as IPX4 water resistant, which I'm going to say is legit since the warehouse does get hot and as a result, I do get pretty sweaty.***UPDATE #2, 09/10/2021***I once again find myself HATING these earbuds! After working perfectly for a few weeks, the left earbud of the REPLACEMENT (2nd) pair I got stopped working. Just like the 1st pair, I tried multiple resets, both soft and factory, and I get no audio from left side whatsoever. I also checked my devices' settings and can confirm that they work perfectly and are not the issue. At this point, I probably won't bother contacting support again and will just get rid of them. $130 in the trash thanks to Sennheiser!","Reviewed in the United States August 7, 2021",AGCJFB7PLYJWNNGPHSOJ4A2LKAEA,TRUE,57,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone

So I decided to try these Sennheisers out as a replacement, and I'm really glad I did. The clarity and overall sound quality is leaps and bounds better than the Airpods. And the battery life is far superior as well. I take long walks every day with these, and only need to charge them maybe once every other week? Phenomenal.My only two gripes would be 1. the size of the case, which is somewhat bulky when shoved into a jeans pocket, and 2. the rubber tips that are included. Although they do provide 3 sizes (small, medium, large), I found all sizes of the Sennheiser tips to be too shallow for my ear canal, causing the buds to fall out rather easily. However, I replaced the tips with some slightly deeper ones (from an old pair of $30 sony's), and now they fit perfectly with no issue.","Reviewed in the United States March 8, 2022",AFZ7QT7BY5SUCXWO6MDQELMKKC3A,TRUE,1,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone

They have superb sound quality, but there were a lot of issues I had with them. They were large with annoying battery leakage and fast battery depletion. I bought these in April when I started a new job because I would be taking a train regularly. I wanted something affordable but didn't want to sacrifice the sound quality that I was enjoying before, with a much better battery quality. These really haven't disappointed. They're not quite as good sound as the MOMENTUMS, but they are still very good for $70. I reckon most other brands you'd have to be spending at least $150 for this quality of sound. The battery life is incredible on them and they're my daily use when I'm commuting. The touch controls are great, much more intuitive than the MOMENTUMs. Their size is a massive improvement over the first MOMENTUMS, they do not stress my ears nearly as bad. Couldn't have been happier with this purchase. Sennheiser is the only audio company I purchase from, and they have rarely missed for me. At this price range, it's an automatic recommendation if anyone ever asks.

The (8 HOUR MAX) battery life is valid for only one of the earbuds, the other dies in half the time causing the other to also start spewing its ""Battery Low"" message until you set it back to charge. They say 27 hour only because you get about 3 Charges from the case, which is also Sad. The material they're made of (including the case) provides ZERO grip so you'll most likely have them simply slipping out of your grasp AND your ears. They refuse to stay in even during something as simple as a light walk, you'll find yourself constantly having to push them back in place. As for the connection, it's Horrid. As many other reviews state, sometimes one bud doesn't connect and you have to factory reset them about three times in a row to fix the issue. The Range is hot garbage. Doesn't even extend down a 12 ft. hallway. My 7+ year old Skullcandy Hesh headphones have a longer range. A joke to be sure.

She and I compared them the other day to a pair of very high end buds given her by the record company as a gift. The ones she had were at least four times the cost of these Sennheiser but neither she nor I could hear much difference.

This means that when they are on your ears or in your ears, you feel like the sound is outside of your ears instead of right in your eardrum. This creates a soundstage with more depth and clarity. These are not the headphones to bump your trap music to. These are headphones to enjoy great acoustic music, classical music, jazz, watch movies, and enjoy some rock music.

App that was suggested also helped to make the experience better and things went pretty smooth once I was able to figure out the equalizer. There is a sign up option to get a more user experience friendly equalizer which is great but it doesn't take that long to sign up and get into it. You can use one at a time as well and they have a long distance before they start to break up in signal. The bass is great and it isn't over the top. The feel of them and weight of them is perfect so no issues. It even latches into your ears pretty well so I had no issue at the gym with them.

RSSYA1ZUT9YI6,B08ZR5JB9G,2.0 out of 5 stars Too many connection issues,Sierra,2,"I've had these for a few months now and I've noticed I've had a lot of connection issues with my earbuds from the start. I use them every day and too many times have one earbuds connection been much weaker and the volume is drastically lower than the other (happens with both ear buds) and turning them off and on again and returning them to the case isn't enough and I'll have to repair my earbuds. I've had to do this every few weeks, sometimes even a few times in a week and pairing them has proven to be much more difficult than it should be. Often it said the earbuds couldn't be paired even though they were turned on and full battery. Another thing, my left earbud will die almost an hour before my right one does, and I make sure to clean them well so they charge.My left earbud also has the most connection issues as recently I'll hardly tap it or move my head and the earbud will lose connectivity and buffer a lot. I never listen to my earbuds with more than half volume as I don't need it because the sound quality is pretty good, but that means I know my speaker isn't blowing out and there's just issues with the manufacturing of this product. I never had these issues with my galaxy earbuds, and am quite frustrated. Other than these issues, they have good quality and potential. Hopefully it's just my earbuds that are like this and not the product as a whole.","Reviewed in the United States April 18, 2022",AHNMLAD5TCX67UDZIRG34YCIUXYA,TRUE,2,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone
R2TFFHXODEW9TJ,B08ZR5JB9G,2.0 out of 5 stars Problems With Connection,Hydromantes,2,"I recommend that you do not buy Sennheiser earbuds. Like all manufacturers, they will change the name of this model if they have not already done so to deflect their products from bad reviews so I can't trust anything they make.I've used these for over a month now and they keep disconnecting. I use them for several hours every day and this happens three or four times each week. If there is no audio for a few minutes, they disconnect but they will re-connect with a single click which is a minor inconvenience. However, they also just stop working randomly and will not re-connect at all. That could be a problem connecting with Bluetooth, but often one earbud will continue working when the other earbud is dead and must be re-charged. That proves that it is not a Bluetooth problem but a problem with the earbuds. Even after recharging, the dead earbud will not always re-connect easily. Frequently I need to remove them from my Bluetooth list then re-pair them which is a major inconvenience. I used to have a pair of wireless Sennheiser headphones that also would not stay connected. It seems Sennheiser doesn't know how to make something that will connect to Apple devices, which is too bad because they sound great and I like the controls.","Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2023",AG26TQWV757VVM7CQB7OTPND3ESA,TRUE,0,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone

Everyone has different hearing, individual preferences and varying levels of ability to detect (or even care about) audio fidelity. First impression out of the box: Well-made and beautifully packaged. It took me far too long to figure out why they weren't charging; turns out there was plastic film over the terminals, which I don't believe the documentation mentioned. (The documentation is pretty lame, btw...) Once over that hump, as soon as I got them connected to Bluetooth and to the app, it asked for a firmware update; this took an incredibly long time. First impression of the sound: crisp, clear, not quite loud enough (for me), but the low end is sorely lacking. Treble perhaps too bright. The EQ inside the app is pretty clever and helped improve the sound, but I was still hoping for more...ooomph...presence...<insert other audiophile words>. (For reference, I was listening to Spotify Premium (highest quality) over Bluetooth.) Phone call performance is excellent. Fairly comfortable/good fit. Overall, these are probably better than I'm making them sound.

The main issue is that sometimes one or both headphones will stop working or desync from my phone for no reason and with no solution. I have gone months (Multiple times) with only one headphone working while the other one blinks red and green like a Christmas tree only to fix itself randomly months later. Again, this has happened several times with both headphones. Sometimes for days, sometimes for months. They have also reset any settings that I had changed in the Sennheiser app, so that's useless.And to add insult to injury, they sound just as good as the $30 TaoTronics I had a few years back. Not bad... But you won't be catching any fine detail in your music. Definitely not worth the asking price.Just don't buy these.

The sound is deep, and super loud, and I can't hear anything above my music. I will be test driving them on an airplane to hear how well the noise cancellation works. I have only tried one size of the tips, so maybe they are a tiny bit uncomfortable because I have the wrong size. I will try other sizes soon.

R1JBQTP05FUBYC,B08ZR5JB9G,5.0 out of 5 stars Great for the price,DocBrown,5,"I‚Äôve been reluctant to go wireless, mostly because of sound quality issues of Bluetooth. But I really like the idea of being free from wires while at work, I already have phone/meeting headsets that are Bluetooth and love them. These went on sale Cyber Monday for a good price so I thought I‚Äôd try them.I found them a little bit of a pain to setup. The ‚ÄúQuick setup guide‚Äù was lacking information. Once I downloaded the full manual I figured out what I was missing and then got them setup and working with my phone. Sound is very clear and bass is excellent and not muddy. It does take a little tweaking of the EQ in the Smart Control app. Noise cancellation is very good considering its passive. These are generally comfortable but can cause a little fatigue if in for long periods. I‚Äôm in and out of meetings everyday so generally this is not a problem for me. I have found that I cannot position them the same in each ear. Everyone‚Äôs ears are different but unfortunately the only way to know is to try them. Battery life is good, though I stick them in the case when I leave my desk and the charge tops off on its own. Being Bluetooth, they do drain my phone a lot more than wired buds. I can‚Äôt comment on failed bub issues yet, it‚Äôs too early, so we‚Äôll see.I didn‚Äôt intend for these to be used with phone calls but ended up taking a few calls while wearing them. I was surprised at how good the voice sounded. Warm and no distortion. The person I was talking to said it was pretty good. She had no trouble hearing me.A few complaints in the reviews I noticed of which have fairly simple solutions.1) Lack of bass. Make sure you are using the correct size ear adaptor and that it is snug in your ear. This is critical. They have the medium on out of the box. They seemed fine, but after a couple of days I took a chance and tried the large. Wow, dramatically better. I also found you have to wiggle it just a little to get the maximum effect. Also download the Smart Control app to get a bit more bass from the EQ. I suggest trying the Sound Check component of the app.2) For the units that are prematurely dying, I wonder if the contacts are dirty. The full manual specifies they do need to be cleaned from time to time. Also, they do have a 2 year warranty but you have to contact a Sennheiser partner.EDIT: I mentioned above that I got a little fatigued with them in for a while. After pulling out a couple of hunks of ear wax with the right ear bud, I decided to try some ear wax remover. Not only do the bud fit better, they are more comfortable. Something to think about if you are experiencing discomfort.","Reviewed in the United States December 2, 2022",AFWLU4KB7AN2ZGSOS3HICOKC44SQ,TRUE,26,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone
R1YXPTOD9CWT3I,B08ZR5JB9G,5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound at a good price,Ben W.,5,"I recently lost my AirPods on a trip and was looking for something to replace them. I didn‚Äôt want to pay what they wanted for the AirPod pros and I wasn‚Äôt really impressed with the sound quality of the AirPods, so I went looking for the best sounding sub 130$ wireless earbuds I could find. I settled on the CXs and received them today. I‚Äôll get to the sound quality at the end but first let me go over some other aspects. The set up was extremely simple, there are clear directions, I just pulled them out of the box removed the very obvious and labeled plastic covers on the battery contacts and then charged the earbuds for about an hour. Once they were charged they paired with my iPhone no problem I also downloaded the app which worked without issue. The fit is slightly less comfortable then the AirPods however they are not uncomfortable and feel quite secure. These buds lack ANC however I don‚Äôt think that will be an issue as they are very effective at blocking outside noise. The touch controls are intuitive and work smoothly. So far I have used them both together and one at a time and have taken them in and out of the case and have no issue with connectivity, you do have to reconnect to the app if you disconnect from Bluetooth however the app does have to be running for the earbuds to work, only if you want to run the equalizer also reconnecting to the app is very simple. The only ‚Äúissue‚Äù I have had so far is when I updated the firmware; everything went fine however be prepared to have your phone and earbuds tied up for about 40 minutes while the firmware updates; during this process the app needs to stay open and the earbuds need to be close to the phone. It‚Äôs a little nerve racking because I was worried if for some reason the update was interrupted it could brick the earbuds, that being said it went fine just took a long time(the app does give a fairly accurate countdown so that helps a little). So how do they sound? There is no doubt these are the best sounding pair of earbuds I have personally heard in my life. I‚Äôve owned the AirPods, the Jabra 65t, first generation beats, and a couple different Chinese pairs; none of those are even in the same category. These where the first earbuds I‚Äôve had that do not sound like music is just being pumped into my ear canals; the music sounds like it‚Äôs naturally coming from the surroundings. Every instrument and vocal track are clear and separate. The bass and treble sound great and balanced and if you really like pronounced bass you can turn it up in the equalizer and it thumps. It‚Äôs really hard for me to overstate how awesome the sound is, I listened to a few songs that are now in lossless Dolby atmos on Apple Music and it‚Äôs nothing short of incredible. The best metaphor I can think of is all of my old earbuds were like Standard definition and these are 4K. So if your looking for the best sound for your money and probably the best sound for under 200$ these are the way to go.","Reviewed in the United States August 5, 2021",AE7GOV7WYUWHSSVCGB5SQSMJI34Q,TRUE,76,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone
R19VWKTRIXU414,B08ZR5JB9G,4.0 out of 5 stars Solid choice for ear buds,Crotorious,4,"I've used these ear buds for almost 2 years and strongly considered re-buying them once I started facing issues. When it comes to sound quality, they're good, and the latency is small, but you'll notice it's there. The best part of these ear buds has to be the battery life; these things last all day, and can be fully charged back up twice with the case. Though if you're looking for something with strong noise cancellation, you might want to consider looking for a different pair of ear buds, as these are really only capable of blocking out most speech. Overall, they're a pretty good pair of ear buds, but I do have a few problems with them.First, when they get to low battery, the text to speech voice will say ""Recharge headset"" just frequently enough to become mildly vexing. This is my primary complaint about these ear buds.Now mind you, I haven't treated these ear buds very well, they went through constant abuse and were used in sub-optimal environments the entire time I've owned them. The next two complaints are likely a result of my poor treatment of these.Second, after about two years of use, their connectivity isn't as great anymore; the range in which I can use these has dropped considerably. I used to be able to walk in my backyard without issues, but now I can barely leave the room without the connection dropping constantly.Lastly, the left earbud has recently developed a problem with connecting to the case; it seems the leads just don't connect half the time. This occasionally causes small inconveniences with the left ear bud turning on in the case and randomly hijacking the audio output of my pc, or it just doesn't end up charging and I'm stuck with a single ear bud until I manage to get it to charge again.Overall, this is a pretty good product. I'd recommend it to anyone who needs a pair of long-lasting wireless earbuds and doesn't need the best sound quality or noise cancellation.","Reviewed in the United States December 22, 2023",AFRT3UTZANKCA7EGGKYQAVIXOJ5Q,TRUE,1,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone
RB0NQXL4O1IZ,B08ZR5JB9G,1.0 out of 5 stars Only really lasted 8 months,Jake Boop,1,"Edit: originally rated 1 star as the earbuds that I received were open-box/used. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to Sennheiser that my 1 star rating remains on here because that was a fault of Amazon. These earbuds sound great. Absolutely great. The connection seems to be good so far as well (I‚Äôve seen a lot of negative reviews saying otherwise). They are very comfortable for my ears, I‚Äôm a Tool Maker/machinist and wear an earbud in one ear I all day and other earbuds that I‚Äôve tried get uncomfortable or start to fall out but I have had no issues with fit at all. As far as the features on the app: the equalization is only a 3-band eq which is a shame, I‚Äôd much rather at least a 5 or 7-band eq but it‚Äôs better than nothing for sure. The side tone feature is supposed to use the mic to feed into the speaker, allowing you to hear outside talking, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to really work at all. I haven‚Äôt tested a phone call using them yet so maybe my mic is defective but I really wouldn‚Äôt care because I don‚Äôt need it. Overall this is a great pair of earbuds for the price.Original review: This item came in with the packaging already opened with another piece of tape over the original seal. The earbuds were covered in earwax and ear hair. Disgusting. If I wanted to buy an ‚Äúopen box/used‚Äù I would‚Äôve selected that option instead of paying full price for it.Edit 3/14/2023: it's been 8 months and the connectivity issues have been becoming a decent problem. I take them out of the case and they won't connect, so I put them back it and take them out again and usually they'll connect after the second try. But lately I've been having to re-pair them to my phone. I'll take them out of the case and instead of the usual ""power on..... connected"" notification, it's just silence. And it's not as simple as just re-pairing them because they won't go into pairing mode unless I reset them. The battery life is also taking a dive.I started out really loving these, now I've been very disappointed because they're just such a hassle to deal with. With all of this, especially only being 8 months of use, I'm going to have to update my review from 5 stars to 2.Edit 7/17/2023: the right earbud just stopped working all together, it'll power on but refuses to connect to BluetoothEdit 1/24/2024: I've been trying to get as much use out of these just to justify the amount I spent on them before I replace them but all it has really given me is issues with connectivity and reliability. I expect any earbuds at this price range to last years, I should have no problem getting the same life out of earbuds that you would expect from a phone. I wish I would've just either returned them or thrown them away a long time ago. I'm going to start looking into replacements now. Adjusting my 2 star rating to a 1 star.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2022",AE2R5XX5O7LVG57B7S2L22VH2QIA,TRUE,10,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone
R32H19VXW9WGNF,B08ZR5JB9G,5.0 out of 5 stars Comparison with Momentum TW,Steve Kranyec,5,"I have a pair of CX's that are about 1.5 years old, and another set that I just recently purchased. In the middle, I have a pair of Momentum TW 3's that are ~6 months old. The TLDR here is that instead of repurchasing the Momentum, I got another pair of the CX's.I'm not an audiophile, and I mostly listen to audiobooks and make calls with earbuds, so I'm not going to be speaking to audio quality at all. For me, it's fine.My six month old Momentum's have a dead left earbud. Possibly this is anecdotal, but if anything I was more gentle with the Momentum's than the CX's, and the CX's have lasted three times as long. Yes, I drop them. Yes, the dead left Momentum died after the most recent drop. I'm not saying that earbuds should survive infinite drops, but in my experience, the CX's are more durable.I did really really like the ANC on the Momentum's. It killed the battery life, but when you need ANC, it was great to have. The pass-through audio was also awesome. It was almost like having a mini-hearing-aide.The CX's have been substantially less finicky than the Momentum. They connect quicker, I've had to reset them fewer times, and they seem to have better range.Between the (substantial) difference in price and the areas where the CX's are superior, I my opinion, the CX's are the better option. If dropping $150 every six months on earbuds is within your budget, I fully endorse the Momentums. For me, I need to have two working sets around at any given time as I wear them a substantial amount of my waking hours, so I'd rather swap to an overear model when I need ANC and go with the cheaper and more durable option.Quick recommendation -- splurge on the foam eartips. If you're like me and wear earbuds an unhealthy amount of time, they're substantially more comfortable. They do wear out, and they're not cheap, but the added comfort for long-wears is huge.","Reviewed in the United States June 9, 2023",AGW3GZDQI7IIZB7FOD2IAOKUKMGA,TRUE,8,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone

A perfect example of the sound is with FFDP ""A little bit off"" which has extremely clean sound on a quality system. These ear buds lack the clean treble when the high hat hits and the deep tones of the bass. If you just want sound without worrying being an audiophile they're good.The bad, no noise cancelling... at all! During phone calls the mic is good in a quiet place. if there is ANY background noise, they will pick up that noise over your voice. I tried them multiple times in different cars and no matter the amount of road noise it drowned out my voice making conversations almost impossible unless I yelled. In an office environment the sound of the keyboard while typing would make conversation hard to understand for whoever was sorry enough to be on the other end of the call.I've been a Sennheiser fan for a long time and have had many of their headphones (still use some old wired buds CX100II for listening to music at work and love them), these are the first that I am returning due to be unusable for conversation.","Reviewed in the United States March 9, 2024",AHYASE5EWU5VJUIBY7QPUY6JS6FA,TRUE,0,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone
R1DTEWZS5AYFKH,B08ZR5JB9G,2.0 out of 5 stars Not quite what I expected,Michal D. Wisteria,2,"So I'll start with the positive. The headphones are comfortable, the sound is great, and the battery life is pretty good too (supposed to be 9.5 hours, I got around 7). The bass felt great, skipping songs was a breeze, and the sound quality when answering calls on them was decent as well.The less great parts. After 6 1/2 hours or so, one headphone would die, usually the left one. Then the right would reconnect, and I could keep listening to things for a bit longer. But the biggest reason for the 2 star review is that my right earbud broke after about 11 months. I took good care of these headphones; they were usually in their case or in my ear. Last week I noticed the right earbud had no sound. I thought I just had to restart them and reconnect, but after a few tries of that I heard just hints of sound for half a second when moving the earbud in the ear, so I knew the audio wasn't working. But all the other features were. I could still pause, skip songs, etc with the right or left earbud. I went on my order page on Amazon and found the support section. There was a link to a product support site for Sannheiser... It was 404, page not found. There was a phone number too.... It was disconnected apparently.

I prefer over-ear headphones, but needed something small, portable and more discreet for work.These looked decent and my past experiences with Sennheiser sound quality also helped make my decision at the time.Sound quality is excellent, overall noise isolation is pretty good for no ANC, bass mids and highs are all present and clear. I do own several pairs of studio/reference headphones, which these obviously don't compare to, but they do manage to make a good account of themselves. Battery lifespan is excellent too and despite no wireless charging (not that it was a deal breaker in my case) the case charged very quickly. Just would have been nice if the charging cable was longer than the dinky one supplied.I used the smallest set of ear cushions, these are decently comfortable for up to a couple hours but do start to press against my ears for longer periods.Construction quality of the case and buds is decent, not too heavy but not feather light either. It's a shame that doesn't go into the internal electronics.First off, the Bluetooth connectivity is not a win. These would repeatedly disconnect themselves when bringing them out of ""sleep"" always one or the other bud. The Sennheiser Smart Control App does allow customization of the buds controls and a graphic equalizer. But it would keep proclaiming it needed a update, even though it was the most up-to-date version.Now these, when they paired, sounded great. After using these for nearly a year, the right bud suddenly had an internal fault and produced flakey, weak sound. That was not a Bluetooth issue, but rather the hardware either failing on a circuit level or a wire becoming loose due to a cold solder joint. I've owned plenty of headphones that are more cheaply made than these with worse sound quality but still function as intended.Looking up this problem seems to be inherit with the CX True Wireless, with complaints occuring anywhere from a few months of ownership to nearly a year or more. Replacements from Sennheiser have been described as having a repeat issue after a similar period of time, or are merely DOA.Shame, this isn't the Sennheiser I knew. Time for a different pair from a different manufacturer.

The same goes with Sony C500:1) The base is precise and it is not bloomy or overwhelming2) The treble is a little bright, but not harsh (Jabra Elite 7 Pro has a treble that hurts my ears). I use the equalizer to dial down the treble and dial up the mid just a bit to make it sounds slightly warmer.3) The mid is very detail. I can hear the singers express their emotions very clearly. Much more detail than Bose to my ears (but Bose sounds fuller and richer).4) The sound is dynamic. I feel it can bring out the excitement in music without being overwhelming (more than Bose but Bose has better instrument separation and ""layering"")Other Pros:1) It is super comfortable. I can listen to it many hours without taking it off.2) The equalizer is much better than Jabra. It shows the frequency as well as the decibel.A few things to watch out for:1) Even though the sound is very detail but it also sounds thin, especially for male vocals with deeper voice. Using the equalizer to dial up the mids helps a little bit.2) It sound pretty bad on voice calling.3) Noise Cancellation is not good. I can hear people chatting in the office. I guess it is a give-and-take. This earbud does not require a deep in-ear fit (to be comfortable), so it could be harder to get good noise cancellation. On the other hand, Jabra has good passive noise cancellation, but it is not nearly as comfortable (it has a deeper in-ear fit).I primarily look for a inexpensive earbuds to use in office with good sound and comfort.

They stay in place very well during intensive workoutsSound quality: For the money, I've pretty impressed with the sound quality. I own an amp and DAC, planar magnetic headphones, and a pair of wired balanced armature earbuds. So I love good headphones. These give my balanced armature earbuds a good run for their money. These don't have huge bass, but the bass is punchy and well controlled. Highs and mids are good, and there's decent separation and a nice airiness about these. Overall, these have a very well controlled sound profile and work well with most any music genre. These also isolate pretty well, so good that I see no need for wireless buds with noise cancellation, which I personally think is a gimmick that only causes increased drain on the batteries.Battery life: pretty decent, these don't have noise cancelling tech, so battery life is much better than buds that have that tech. One important note, I've found the right earbud will drain faster than the left if I use it frequently to advance or replay tracks.Sony headphone app: I'd recommend downloading the Sony headphone app as this allows you some equalizer features and let's you turn off the buds using the app. Also, the app has some other bells and whistles like an ear analyzer that takes a picture of your ear and optimizes sound to fit your ears. However, you'll need to download one of several 3rd party apps to take advantage of this feature.Overall, these are a fantastic deal for the money, with typical Sony quality and functionality. They work great with my Iphone and integrate with Siri, so you'll have that functionality as well.","Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2021",AFXBGMTYGUQHDCUX3ZTPDNJDVCTA,TRUE,10,Color: Black

R3GLIY6F2SM3PR,B09CFP6J6D,4.0 out of 5 stars Great ear buds,Amazon Customer,4,"I purchased these a couple weeks ago. I wanted to write an honest review after using them for a while.I'm very happy with them. I tried a different brand but returned them after a couple days. These are heads and shoulder above those.I was concerned that they would fall out, but they fit snuggly, and they stay put without being uncomfortable. I use them when I workout, lifting, riding the bike or running, they have never fallen out. When I remove them, I have to gently tug on them for them to come out. Just make sure you are using the right size rubber attachments.I'm impressed with the sound quality. The app works well and you can actually hear the changes when you change modes.As far as noise cancellation--its more of the rubber inserts than the electronics IMHO. If I'm not listening to music or on a call they act like ear plugs. If you've ever talked wearing ear plugs, you know what I mean. However, when I'm walking the dogs or out in the wind, I can still hear the music with very little wind noise. It's almost as if I have over the ear headphones on.I'm still trying to determine the battery life. I wear them for a couple hours while exercising and a few hours after--I can wear them about 2 days like this until I need to recharge. I don't like to recharge until they are below 20%. The charging case will charge them up to about 75% in about an hour or less.I gave them a 4 because they are small and will sometimes slip out of my fingers when I remove them from my ears.I have the Bose noise cancelling over ear headphones and these are (almost) comparable to those for sound.","Reviewed in the United States March 26, 2022",AFXGIV2Y74ZI5ZM2XJJROSNCIHDA,TRUE,1,Color: Black

Nice not to have to carry my phone as I work!! Nothing bad as of yet.Sony WF-C500I hate the books some people write so short and sweet. I have always bought budget brand earbuds...lose/break etc... but paid a bit more for my last pair from Motorola. Unfortunately I lost one of them while out cruising on my bike. So decided to again pay a bit more for a better quality brand. Motorola was a nice pair and no real complaints other than the select switch on the bud was very touchy but not a deal breaker...just be more careful.Out of the box on normal basic Sony settings I was twice as impressed by the sound quality as the MOTO. Down loaded the Sony app and it made a nice improvement but not overwhelmingly so. Having said that, this is my best favorite pair in the 10 pair in 4 yrs I have been using wireless earbuds. Battery bud is bigger than I like but not a deal breaker...stays in place, sound is the best I have yet heard in a pair of buds(a bit to much bass for me...I like more treble than most younger people so the app helped me there).For the price you can't be to unhappy with this pair. If you are a uber discerning audiophile pay 3-400 and get the best but if just purely listening well floats your boat as it does me...these do an most excellent job.Now a several weeks in and still awesome...Connection- GreatSound- very good and very adjustable with appbattery/charging- GreatDefinitely repurchase if I lose or damage this pair!!2 months...still awesome...nothing bad to addBattery is greatStay put in the earSound is great","Reviewed in the United States September 1, 2022",AE4DRQQDH3DYGY72PDKMKDDRUJOA,TRUE,84,Color: Black

R1ZPOE559OPBBT,B09CFP6J6D,4.0 out of 5 stars Very good,ariel villalona,4,"these in ears have several points to highlight.

1. Noise cancellation is passive, even with the headphones turned off, the outside noise is greatly reduced. Already with music on, it cancels out like 85% of the noise I feel this percentage lower depending on how loud the outside noise is.

2. The comfort is super super good, since I received them I use it 10 hours in a row every day, and it's as if I didn't have anything on. They don't fall off if I move my head, it doesn't bother, they fit well.

3. connectivity, the distance is very good. I can leave my cell phone in one place and walk around the house without losing sound quality.

4. I don't know if the battery is due to my use, but it lasts longer than the brand says. I charge them once every 3, 4 days.

5. the functions (buttons) are easy to use, and even though they are physical buttons, it doesn't bother to press them. And here's why I don't give them 5 stars:

when I use a single earphone, I lose all the functions of the headset that I'm not using. In my opinion, they should have kept the options of the right earphone, which are to change and pause the songs, because if I use only the left one I have to use the mobile phone if I want to pause or change a song.","Reviewed in the United States January 16, 2023",AF4LRKZWKMEVP4IL72OZQ6ZVAAKA,TRUE,11,Color: Black

And overall they are decent earbuds but if you're a music holic like me than you may not be too satisfied. I always been a big fan of Sony products and have had their earbuds in the past so I thought these were going to be great for me. Pros: Battery life is amazing! I used them for about a week before the battery was even close to dying. And I don't use them just a few times a day, I listen to music bascally all day long after work and at gym. So I am extremely impressed with the battery life. Also, they feel very comfortable in your ear, you can barely feel they are in there. Another pro is that they are easy to store in their case and the case is small enough to put in your pocket to carry around. Cons: Doesn't have the best noise cancellation and volume is kind of low. I am able to hear a lot of noise even when volume is all the way up. My main thing about earbuds is not hearing the outside world. I like to be focused on me and the music Im listening to.

R3GCQKFGE5YLW9,B09CFP6J6D,5.0 out of 5 stars I am shocked at how good these sound!,Nicolas Dozmati,5,"I typically don't write reviews, even if I like the product a lot. This set of earbuds absolutely surpassed my expectations for bluetooth audio quality; I even have a set of wired ones also by Sony that don't sound as good as these ones.I own a Galaxy/Android device, although the packaging claims that they only pair to Apple products, I had zero issues pairing my earbuds and their app is very user friendly. It's also a bonus that the case takes a USB Type C, same charging cord as my Galaxy phone and several phones out there (comes with cord too).The loudest of loud volumes can't even be heard from outside of the earbuds when correctly fitted to the ear, so you don't have to worry about being that guy with the loud heavy metal on your transit.My only complaint is that while you can seamlessly wear either earbud interchangeably, you cannot remap what functions the bud performs; right one does the pause-play functions while the left controls volume. I would just prefer pause-play on both, but maybe the volume function will grow on me. Also, the touch features for the earbuds are a press-down activation, not a finger sense, which I both prefer and kinda don't, depends on the earbud; this one does it right.To restate it, I am absolutely in shock at how good these wireless Sony earbuds are. While I am no review guru, I hope you take my word and praise for these bluetooth earbuds by Sony! :D","Reviewed in the United States June 22, 2022",AG6GMWWJADURM4YKB37CEQEBKQZQ,TRUE,5,Color: Black

My first pair of another brand had to be returned because they rain out of battery time during the night, but they had the noise cancelling option.The Sony's do not have a the noise cancelling option, which is why, I guess, the play time is much longer than the other.They come with an app you can download which allows you to turn off ALMOST ALL of the voice commands that the other set would set off during the middle of the night. The caveat in the app setting is that it will still send what it considers to be ""important"" voice commands (I notice ""power on"" when first putting on).I would say the biggest negative is that, if wearing for sleep, the bud buttons can be set off easier than the other set I tried, but I tap the right one and it was back to the rain sound (Amazon prime music)Overall, a good earbud for sleeping, but have not used for daytime listening or phone usage.","Reviewed in the United States April 3, 2022",AE6TKNGDLNLFRMRPEJG7JNUT2MEA,TRUE,1,Color: Black

They come with 3 different ear piece sizes and can fit pretty comfortably. They do pretty well with noise cancellation as I work in a loud environment and they tune out sounds very well even with music at very low volume.With about 8 hours of use per day I can go 6 days of use before the batteries completely deplete.So overall for the price (I paid 68$) it is 100% worth it for the use I have gotten out of them so far.

The charging case could stand to be a little slimmer for people who carry it in their pocket. I also would really love to see some case covers for these cases. My only gripe is that the big buttons are a bit of an issue. When you try to push the headphones into your ears or adjust them, you can't help but push the button. So you end up either decreasing or increasing volume, etc etc. I also feel like the button protrudes enough that if I lay on my side it will likely get pressed by my pillow.","Reviewed in the United States October 10, 2022",AEFOP3JBF2T2AVIHER37FCDKKWSQ,TRUE,33,Color: Black

R276VWWAGXV6VT,B09CFP6J6D,1.0 out of 5 stars Readme 1st: Not for Windows users... Mediocre sound quality even by Sony standards.,Persepolis,1,"This is on the cheaper end of Sony's offerings, given the price tag I would at a minimum expect good quality... wrong. It falls short of a 10 year old wired Sony MDREX58V, at 3x the price...Here are the pro's and con's:Pro: Quick bluetooth connect/disconnects.Con: Audio quality is just BAD... tinny and weak out of the box. It falls short of an older Sony MDREX58V I have which is only $20, it falls short of most $20-$30 no-name ear buds, and falls, and falls pretty close to a set of freebie earbuds I got while flying United a few years back. This is not good! I think Sony tried to differentiate between their high end offerings so badly that they killed the quality on this one so they can fill the lower price tier.Pro: Comfortable fit, lighter than some of the other ear buds I've used.Con: Software to control behavior is only available on Android and iOS... so if you're using it on a Windows PC, while it will pair and it will ""function"", it sounds like crap... and it will stay that way. In 2019, there were about 850mil iPhones in use... and about 900mil Windows PC's in use... not sure the what ledge the MBA's hit their heads on before deciding Windows users don't get the app thats needed to properly use these earbuds. For yuks sake, I do have both an iOS device and an Android... and installed the app on both of those... and the sound quality didn't get much better by adjusting the equalization envelope. Increasing the base just seemed to eat away at the midrange... It was weird to say the least.Pro: It can be reasonably loud. So you're getting mediocre sound, just loud mediocre sound... LOL.Anyways... summary: This is a low price offering from Sony that has been neutered so they can offer you something for $60... the only problem is that it performs worse than the $20 offering from others.Lack of a Windows app was not a particularly good decision given how low performing these are... a little bit of signal processing could have helped save these a bit...Summary: Save your money...

The only real negative is the main button (only in the right side) is large... perhaps too large.As I wear them longer, like all headphones they shift within my ears, so they require adjusting.

It was such an extended ordeal, I've no idear what was the final solve or how it finally worked.

I would recommend charging it overnight. The second is that there are still some small technical problems.

They also have buttons on the side for touch controls (pause/play, volume control, call pickup/end) and Sony allows for some sound customization in the app. Best part about them is that they are independent and each earbud (Left or Right) can be used alone unlike some other budget wireless earbuds.

R1G28XEXNA4QFG,B09CFP6J6D,5.0 out of 5 stars Sony Quality Shines Through with these Earbuds!,Shawshank,5,"I ordered these earbuds because I wanted a quality set of earbuds that weren't a cheap throwaway pair after a year but didn't want to drop the coin on a set of Apple or Bose earbuds. Sony has a good rep in the consumer electronics space and after doing a little research outside of Shamazon, I decided I would give the WF-C500's a shot. A few things I like about these specific buds.1. Fitment - they fit in my ears well and they stay in my ears without causing hot spots or pain points.2. Battery life - I can't give you a precise number, but I can use these earbuds throughout the day and even into the night and still have some battery life in the morning.3. Sound - These specific earbuds I use primarily for listening to Audible audiobooks, so I don't need an eardrum ticking base or eye-watering treble highs, that said I did test these out with a few of my favorite artists - Hank Williams, Willie Nelson, Armin Van Buuren, Tiesto, AC/DC, old Van Halen, Vivaldi, the usual stuff we all listen to and in each style of music, I was very pleased, it was accurately represented within the context of having a half thimble-sized device stuck in my ear. Win. I also use these for phone calls, when someone calls and interrupts my audiobook, and I've always gotten good feedback from the other person on the call, in terms of clarity, volume of voice, and even outdoors, the wind management seemed to not negatively impact my call.4. Earbud controls - There is a pro/con to the way you control these earbuds. I'll flat-out tell you I am not a fan of the touch-sensitive earbuds. I have big hand and rarely do I touch it in the way it wants to be touched and I end up hanging up on someone while I'm trying to turn up the volume or whatever the case is. The WF-C500's are more of a button-press kind of thing. It's tactile - you know exactly what your finger is doing when it's doing it because of that tactile feedback. I freaking love that. Super-duper simple!! So what's the con Shawshank? Glad you asked. It's probably a horrible habit but I use one of the earbuds when I go to sleep. Usually an audiobook, might be some Ludovico Einaudi, or that soothing ocean or thunderstorm sound with some good ol' scripture in the background. The problem is I'm a side-sleeper and SOMETIMES when I roll over to the side that has the earbud in it, the pillow will act like my finger and hit that little tactile button and pause whatever I'm listening to. I can hit it again and be a little more careful when I put my head back on the pillow, but that does happen. It's probably a bad habit anyway, but that's the con of the controls on these earbuds, from my POV anyway.5. Overall quality - I really can't complain about these earbuds. I've dropped them in the sink while washing my face, and forgotten to take them out when taking a shower (I realized after the water hit my head that I was still listening to whatever it was I was listening to, but they got a good dose of water sprayed on them, and there were times where one did fall out of my ear, primarily because I didn't seat it well.I have been so pleased with these earbuds, that I bought my 17 yr old son a pair and he is also very happy with them. He listens to music primarily, 70-80-90's music (yeah he has good taste in music for a teenager.) :-)An update after I had written this. I ran into a problem with the left earbud not connecting to BT. I contacted Sony support because they have a 1 yr limited warranty, and I bought these back in May of last year. We tried doing a full reset, which didn't correct the problem. The CSR provided me the info to send them back, I received an email with a FedEx shipping label, dropped them off at the Fedex in a Dollar General nearby, 2 days later they arrived at the Sony repair facility, 1 day after that, Sony notified they had ordered a brand new pair of WF-C500's for me and I should get them next week.I'm not usually the kind of guy that gets massively butt-hurt when something breaks. Stuff happens. What I don't enjoy is when I am trying to correct a problem, be it a defect or whatever, with the manufacturer or the store and it becomes a battle of will and plain old integrity of service. My experience with Sony was outstanding. They asked me to try and correct the issue by doing a hard reset and when that didn't work, they moved right into replacement mode. I dig and respect that. So I wholeheartedly recommend this product. Unlike the growing number of Shamazonians who get free stuff to test and write reviews even though in all honestly sometimes they don't know crap about the product, I am a guy who buys his own stuff and in this case, I was 110% daily user of these Sony WF-C500 earbuds - at home, in my truck, at the gym, in the kitchen, in the bathroom (oops), outside mowing my grass and running my airplane sounding weedeater, in all cases this audio was good, and most importantly, I didn't lose one out of my ear and run my mower over it. As far as ""noise cancellation"", I will just refer to the numerous times my bride yelled at me because I didn't hear her when she was talking to me. I suppose in some regards that counts as ""noise cancellation"". (my beautiful Brazilian bride, if you happen to read this, you know your man loves ya.)BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front): They feel good in the ear. They sound good in the ear. You don't look like you have a Chernobyl growth sticking out of your ears like some of the other earbuds. Perhaps best of all - Sony sticks behind their products and they understand what excellent customer service should be. These are the factors that drive my review and are the reason I bought a pair for my son, to whom I don't give him a rock when he asks for bread if you know what I mean. But he never asked for these, I knew the pair he had for 3+ years was having issues and wanted to surprise him. He was surprised on top of being happy. That's probably the highest recommendation I can provide, for what I give to the absolute pride and joy of my life - well I can't see these not being good enough for the King of England if they're good enough for my son.I'll TRY to remember and update my review with some pics when I get the new earbuds. Chances are however, that I will forget and probably remember when I'm in a situation that precludes me from executing the review update in that moment I'm thinking about it. But I'll try. BTW the price dropped on these. I paid $90 bucks for my pair and my sons pair, and I think I saw them for $70ish or $79 and they are worth every buck of that even at $90.","Reviewed in the United States February 23, 2024",AE46KEUAAPWZ3CWV3BKSR4PTUBSA,TRUE,8,Color: Black

First off, I have spent over 20 years in the audio industry and consider myself myself somewhat of an audiophile - so sound quality is very important. Unfortunately, that time in the audio industry listening at high DBs has no doubt cost me some hearing - so strong volume is also very important to me.Thanks to Amazon's return policy I have tried many highly rated ear buds under $100 on the market:Ear Fun Free Pro 2 = Great sound, great NC, good volume but would NOT stay in my ears,Soundcore Anker Life P3 = great sound quality, features, but NOT loud enough.SoundPeats MiniPro AC = Great volume, good sound but stick out way too far and fall out of my ears.Palm Buds Pro = just not loud enough!Soundcore Life A2 NC+ = Great Sound, Great volume, great features but stick out too far and also fall out of my ers!Now on to these Sony WF-C500s = Great sound, very good volume, 10 hour battery life, well designed case, nice app, and fit my ears like a glove. Heck I can even side sleep and not usually press a control accidentally, I have had no problems with people hearing me on phone calls. I can work out and they don't fall out of my ears! While they are not overly bass heavy (more true to the music), it can't be beefed up with the EQ in the app. I made a Custom EQ with pretty much the same settings as the Treble Boost EQ but raised the Clear Bass setting. The result is more than adequate bass, good separation and very good volume. I ordered all the above buds about the same time and when I tried these Sony's I figured they were the keeper. After trying all the others I mentioned, I kept coming back to these WF-C500s!

The case is made of a pretty cheap feeling plastic, but the buds themselves feel higher quality.My main issue with these is that the audio quality (by default, at least) is HORRIBLE. Maybe I'm just spoiled by higher quality, wired earbuds but they are far below average by most standards. The saving grace, however, is that the app lets you tamper with the different levels and tune the audio to your liking. I managed to get it to sound a bit better, but I couldn't find a way to make the audio any louder which is unfortunate. The buds are very quiet.Overall they're pretty good.

The comfort level isn't great although it depends on earsand type and size of the tips, ok, they fit snug, they charge easily and last a long time on charge,very convenient for running around town, etc. walks, exercise, shopping, etc. However, with myiPhone or lossless player, I never, ever achieve the type of power and volume and quality levelsthat I get with my full wired headphone amp/player Fiio rig. These get somewhat loud butnot very, they seem to be limited to a certain threshold and it doesn't matter what the sourceis. I never have those issues with my full wired headphone and IEM rig.For serious listeningI would opt for the latter, always, but the Sony C500 are good when I just want to run aroundtown and even drive and cannot use the full rig I have. The comfort level wasn't great,though, which is a reason I often don't love IEMs or earbuds. For the money these soundpretty good, clear, but I cannot get the type of audiophile performance from them I wouldhope for, due to the wireless, so I guess I just don't love wireless so far. Meanwhile I owna brand new 70 watts per channel BT speaker that blows these earbuds out of the waterin every respect. But that's a fully amped full range portable speaker.Until Sony and other mfgrs. come up with a fully built-in self-amplified BT IEM or earbud,these will be for convenience only, really.

I always check to make sure the light is on, but sometimes it just stops, and you have to adjust it to start charging again.With those two very small complaints taken into consideration, it‚Äôs a very small inconvenience for an extremely high quality product that I use on average, probably 8 hours per day, 6 days per week.If I could give these earbuds a better rating, I would.","Reviewed in the United States April 4, 2024",AHQKL7WVKDS2DSZXMC23IHZ7U4ZA,TRUE,2,Color: Black

Overall they sound pretty good for under $50. The 2 issues I encountered are:1) They don't get loud enough. I used them while I was mowing my lawn and the noise cancelling gets rid of some of the background noise, but not enough to immerse a person in their music if there's something loud in the background.2) They don't go deep enough into the ear canal. In ear monitors need to couple with your ear canal in order to stay in place and reproduce low frequencies well. This made them very light in the bass and if I tried to boost the bass with my phone's EQ, it would start to distort at ""high"" volumes.If they went about a 1/4"" deeper it might take care of both problems. I'll probably look for different ear pieces to attach to these that will go deeper into the ear canal.","Reviewed in the United States October 23, 2023",AGRARCPQFSTBNWQ5KGBZCYQ3YNMA,TRUE,11,Style: Earbuds with Noise Cancelling

R1UP1UTTWDI6CH,B0BZTCXG6T,5.0 out of 5 stars Very nice,Bridgette,5,"Being a huge fan of the Panasonic ergofit wired buds, these were a prime choice for my first pair of Bluetooth earbuds ever. Suffice to say I love Bluetooth earbuds now and will never go back to wired. These buds are great. The charge lasts forever. With a good custom EQ, and Dolby Atmos ON, they provide very nice bass and clear voices. The sound quality is on par with the wired version, all things being equal, as these do have the extra bass from their larger drivers.The buds are black, clean, and no fuss with a neat little angle in them for the ""ergo-fit"" gimmick. I don't think they fit any better than other earbuds, but they do look nice. The buds are also quite large with their 10mm drivers, almost seeming oversized. This gives them a more expensive look.Unlike my husband's other brand of wireless buds, these buds have NO LEDs on the buds themselves, which I quite enjoy. No annoying red/blue lights blinking constantly, and also saves battery, I imagine.Pairing was very simple and quick on my S20 Ultra, without reading any instructions whatsoever, and just opening the case, they immediately showed in the Bluetooth connection and paired quickly. They seem to pair far faster and more reliably than my husband's wireless buds. Simply turn bluetooth on, and tap ""RZ-B310W"". My husband's initial set up for his buds was an annoying dance of pairing each bud separately, and opening and closing the case. These buds both pair at same time, every time for me, and can connect even when they're inside the case charging.The case is nice, minimalistic and has a nice magnetic snap close. No LED screen like my husband's earbuds, but I find that an unnecessary expense. There's a little red LED light to show when it's charging. The tiny case holds many hours of charge, and I'm surprised daily that the buds just keep going, even though I'm wearing them a good portion of the day.The buds snap magnetically into their ports, and I will admit it can be a pain when you go to put them back in figuring out which one goes in which port, as they only go in one way.The buds fit in my ears is ""OK"", not perfect. I have small ear canals. They do stay in, but I can tell when the seal gets broken if I smile or laugh and they move out of place the tiniest bit.That's a small annoyance rather niche for people with tiny ear canals like myself though.I never read the instructions so figured out by trial and error how to activate the different modes and things like pause. Currently to change mode, I cup my palm against the bud as if to push it further in my ear for a couple seconds until I hear the voice over saying what's been activated. Still haven't figured out exactly where to touch and hold with one finger to change modes, but my way works for me.To pause/play, I press a fingertip against the round back of the bud. Unfortunately it's probably quicker to just use your phone to pause/play, as you cannot just tap the bud but have to press and hold for a second. On the other hand, that's a positive as it's much harder to accidentally hit it, unlike my husband's buds, where he often hangs up mid-call because he pushed the bud for a split second to get it back in his ear fully.So, about the noise cancellation, it's pretty nice! There's definitely a noticeable difference between the three modes. I didn't buy these for noise cancelling, but wanted to try it out as I've never had noise cancelling buds.There's ""Ambient Sound"", which amplifies your surrounding noise to hear comfortably even while wearing earbuds. Makes hearing others, and safety sounds like traffic, loud and clear. Not ideal to use when just chilling at home, as it makes surrounding noise very loud, but great in public or if walking/jogging/biking on a road or having a conversation with someone else.There's the option ""Off"" which seems to be just the default experience of wearing normal earbuds. Sound is slightly muffled, but still comes through.Finally, the option for ""Noise Cancelling"", which is quite striking when you use it for the first time. In my room with an AC on and white noise in the background, it dramatically lowered the apparent noise coming into my ears to a near imperceptible whisper. If I didn't know better, I would've thought there was NO AC or white noise in my room and it was near-silent.So, the noise cancellation works great for continuous sounds, yes. But other dynamic noises like human voices, it doesn't work as well. If you are buying these for the noise cancelling element, like if you, say, live in a noisy house and want to sleep better at night, I'd choose a more robust set with great active noise cancelling. Or if you just want to drown out ALL noise around you. But I will say, with noise cancelling on, and some brown noise playing on the buds from YouTube, that would provide a good night's sleep in a noisy home for sure, and it's been done many times by myself since getting these buds.... Only issue is finding them in the morning as they inevitably fall out with my tossing and turning!But I didn't buy these for noise cancelling, though it was a gimmick I wanted to try. I bought these for sound quality, and they deliver, when set up correctly. I've never been one to just use the default sound settings on my phone/PC for any pair of buds I've had, but my initial impression from the DEFAULT EQ on my S20 Ultra was that, out of the box, the buds were too bass-forward for me, at the loss of necessary mids and highs. They sounded a bit, muffled. In music, I prefer the voice to be at the forefront and crystal clear in the genres I enjoy. I also listen to a lot of podcasts, so I quickly did a custom EQ to suit my needs, and I recommend everyone does for *any* pair of headphones they have, as it can make a huge difference. I do listen to rap and hip-hop occasionally, but if that is your *predominant* preference, these may be perfect for you out of the box without adjustment. For other genres and general listening, in my opinion, these are too bassy. I want the bass to be there, but not as front as it comes in these earbuds.There's a nifty setting on the newer android phones to make a custom EQ right in the sound settings without a separate app, and even a way to get a personalized EQ by testing your hearing, to adjust for the loss of perception that comes with age. I recommend playing around with that and making your own custom equalizer to suit your needs if you don't like the initial sound quality.It's exceedingly rare I get a pair of headphones that sound to my liking out of the box, as these days heavy bass is so championed.All that being said, I'm very satisfied with my first set of wireless buds, and I think Panasonic knocked it out of the park at this price point, just like they did with the ergo-fit wired buds I've loved for years.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2024",AEYM6LOYQKQ5PPKYPSKIHFOCX3GQ,FALSE,0,Style: Earbuds with Noise Cancelling

R3NPY1F9JHC976,B0BZTCXG6T,4.0 out of 5 stars Quite impressive,Yan L.,4,"The Panasonic ErgoFit True Wireless Earbuds with Noise Cancelling have impressed me with their exceptional sound quality and convenient features. From their sleek design to their powerful audio performance, these earbuds provide a satisfying listening experience that will elevate your music enjoyment.The first thing that caught my attention was the ergonomic design of the earbuds. They fit snugly and comfortably in my ears, thanks to the multiple sizes of ear tips included in the package. The lightweight construction ensures extended periods of use without discomfort, making them suitable for daily activities or intense workout sessions.The sound quality delivered by these earbuds is truly remarkable. The built-in noise cancelling technology effectively blocks out ambient noise, allowing you to fully immerse yourself in your favorite tunes. The audio is crisp, clear, and well-balanced, with a particular emphasis on the powerful bass response. The XBS (Extra Bass System) feature adds depth and richness to the low-end frequencies, enhancing the overall listening experience, especially for bass enthusiasts.With Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity, pairing the earbuds with my device was seamless and hassle-free. The wireless connection remained stable even when moving around, and I experienced minimal latency while watching videos or playing games. The touch controls on the earbuds provide easy access to playback controls, volume adjustment, and even voice assistant activation, making it convenient to manage your audio on the go.The included charging case is compact and sleek, serving as a secure storage solution for the earbuds while also providing additional battery life. The case's built-in battery can recharge the earbuds multiple times, ensuring that you can enjoy your music throughout the day without worrying about running out of power. The USB-C charging port offers fast charging capabilities, minimizing the downtime between listening sessions.While the Panasonic ErgoFit True Wireless Earbuds deliver excellent sound quality and convenient features, there are a few areas where they could be further improved. The battery life of the earbuds themselves could be extended, as they offer around 4-5 hours of continuous playback, which may not be sufficient for long trips or extended listening sessions without access to the charging case. Additionally, the touch controls on the earbuds can sometimes be overly sensitive, leading to accidental commands.Overall, the Panasonic ErgoFit True Wireless Earbuds with Noise Cancelling offer an impressive audio experience, combining powerful bass, effective noise cancelling, and convenient features in a compact design. Whether you're a music lover, a fitness enthusiast, or someone who appreciates wireless freedom, these earbuds deliver on their promise of immersive sound and provide great value for their price.","Reviewed in the United States June 13, 2023",AEG5NYGZDCB5CQWBIIR2YPNZFQQA,FALSE,4,Style: Earbuds with Noise Cancelling
R1GTMZ7X8PAZVM,B0BZTCXG6T,4.0 out of 5 stars A good performer,WT,4,"The Panasonic RZ-B310W is not currently compatible with the Panasonic Audio Connect app so you are limited to the controls available on the earbuds and there isn't an equalizer. Controls available using the touch panels on the earbuds include music control (pause, forward, backward) and sound control (ANC, ambient sound, off). Unfortunately, sound control toggles from ANC to Off to Ambient Sound. This means it takes two touches to go from ANC to Ambient Sound and I find that to be a bit annoying. I prefer going from ANC to Ambient to Off. You can also turn the buds on or off using the touch panels. The earbuds are lightweight, comfortable and fit my ears well. I can get a good seal using the included eartips and the sound isolation is very good. Construction quality is excellent as you would expect from Panasonic. The charging case is small and will easily slip into a pocket.The earbuds are tuned too bright for my liking. I use the equalizer in my music app to tune the earbuds. The bass is strong without being boomy but sounds a bit loose. The overall sound signature is V-shaped but pleasing to the ear. However, you must get a good seal or the sound is really messed up, with little bass, no midrange and shrill highs. These earbuds are not for critical listening but if you want something for casual listening while commuting or working at your desk, give these a try.Noise isolation and bass response depends on your achieving a good fit with one of the included eartips. If you can't get a good seal, the bass will be nearly non-existant and the treble will overpower everything.Active noise cancellation is better than I expected. It isn't at the level of the Sony WF-1000XM4 or Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2 but it does reduce a significant amount of low frequency noise, like the roar of jet engines. To be honest I wasn't expecting this level of noise cancellation in a $99 earbud. It also does a fair job of reducing office noises.I don't normally use earbuds to make to take calls so I haven't checked the voice quality during calls.Overall, I'm very pleased with the RZ-B310W. I can easily recommend them as one of the best I've used under $100.

RYSBT2D2ZXIFR,B0BZTCXG6T,3.0 out of 5 stars Fine for the Price - But I Have Quirks,Romain,3,"Overall, I think these earbuds are good for the price point, but it has a few quirks that make using them less enjoyable.Sound Quality is its best feature. I tested them against my son's AirPods Gen 2 and my AirPod Pros Gen 1 on an iPhone via Apple Music. My go to song to test listening devices is Ray Charles ""Georgia on my Mind"" (mid volume). That song has a lot happening, and I can pick-up how well the device is as letting you hear all the details. I thought the Panasonic sounded better than the AirPod, and it held its own against the AirPod Pro. Had I played other songs, I think the Pro would win outright because of Spatial Audio features. For added fun, I listen to the track with a wired Beats earbud (lighting cord), and that beat all 3 of them.Ergonomics is Terrible. As others have mentioned, just to get it out of the case is a challenge, if you have larger fingers. When you take it out of your ears, it still plays. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but worth nothing. The case is nice looking but it does not have a sturdy feel. I case see it cracking with a moderate fall to the ground.Software and Other Quirks makes it hard to love. To start, there was no feedback on the case to tell you when it was fully charged, charging the case or charging the ear buds. Same goes with low battery. I could not make out when I needed to charge it, other than waiting for it to not play or connect. Perhaps the app is suppose to help with that? With a good app, it probably would be manageable.It's a very possessive device. As mentioned, I have multiple buds. If I start using the Panasonics, and decide to switch to another device, the Panasonics kept trying to jump back in, even when the buds were in the case. I don't know if I got a bad one or what, but a few times I had to move it away from my phone to get it to not try to take over.If it will be your only bluetooth listening device, and you don't plan on using the buttons, I think it would be fine. For me, I am already slotting the Panasonics as my TV at night device or another dedicated source to avoid it getting confused.","Reviewed in the United States May 17, 2023",AEYMAQNZ7LDD6SWFBFCYN7UCFBLA,FALSE,6,Style: Earbuds
R2VOU38A4NGX3B,B0BZTCXG6T,3.0 out of 5 stars Touch controls are difficult to use and don't work with Android phone,Olivia,3,"These headphones have some positives, but in general I don't think they are worth the money. You can get better earbuds for cheaper than this.To start with, the things I like about them: the fit. I like that they are angled into my ears, and stay in very securely. They come with different headphone tips, although the default ones were just fine for me. I've used these while running and don't slip around or start to fall out.I think the sound is decent -- not great, but not terrible. The bass is well balanced. I also use these for video calls and people report they can hear me well. In video calls, other people's voices sound slightly harsh, which I don't love. But they are definitely servicable sound. If you're really into audio balancing, you probably won't like these, though.The noise cancelling is also somewhat mediocre. I can kinda tell it's doing something, but when people are talking nearby or my dogs bark elsewhere in my house, I can hear it. They don't have the kind of noise cancelling where you put on and remove your headphones and can really notice the difference the noise cancelling makes.The thing I like the least about these are the touch controls. They are really tough to get to work and they don't work beyond play/pause with my Android phone (Pixel 7 pro). When I use these paired to my computer, I have to really focus on how I tap and where exactly my finger lands to get the controls to respond. If I'm wearing these out while running, I have to stop running and hold still to get the play/pause to work. Otherwise, if I'm paired with my phone, I can't get it to advance/repeat track or change volume. I tried downloading the Panasonic devices app, thinking that might be the issue, but I can't get that to work at all (it never pairs with the headphones and is stuck in a loop).In the end, these aren't worth the money to me. I'd rather spend more for a more solid product that works, like Airpods or GalaxyBuds, or go for a cheaper pair that might not have the nice fit, but has more functional touch controls.","Reviewed in the United States June 4, 2023",AGNYUVQAVT6VARWZ5ZNRSFDH3BNQ,FALSE,6,Style: Earbuds with Noise Cancelling
R1X5DJA9RJ2OID,B0BZTCXG6T,4.0 out of 5 stars Punchy sound and a comfortable fit,expatbrit,4,"These are impressive earbuds that do a lot of things right and only come up short in 2 areas.The sound is bass heavy, as expected from the XBS feature, and it can produce some really meaty lows, but this can be dialed down with a good equalizer.Out of the box they sounded a little underwhelming but they improved steadily after a dozen hours or so. I still prefer the more enveloping sound of my Soundpeats buds, but these are more than acceptable, especially with a high bit rate streaming service.There's plenty of volume on tap and the Bluetooth range is a little more than 30 feet, about par for the course across similar products.Panasonic is always good at proving clear instructions, but only the quick start guide is useful here, with picture based instructions. The little booklet offers safety advice in multiple languages, an odd inclusion.One thing these RZs excel at is comfort. Once you find the right rubber tips (3 sizes included) then they stay put, some of the best I've tried. Even talking and eating couldn't shift them, a rare find in my experience. These would make excellent buds for the gym.Battery life is a key selling point on the box, and it's proving correct so far; with minimal charging and extended use, no 'battery low' warning yet. Charging is via a USB C type port, widely becoming the standard these days.One downside is the fiddly shape of the bud and the case, it's all too smooth with no real area to grip, so getting them out of the case takes practice. The touch controls are also slow to respond but work well enough once you get the right zone at the top of the stalk.There's no noise cancelling to speak of (I have tested them on a plane) but they don't claim to have it, so that's OK.For the user looking for a good all-round set of wireless buds, from a household name that will almost certainly be around to honor a warranty in years to come, these are a solid value.","Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2023",AFMRUDC57F6M2LQATDMSNGXBHU3A,FALSE,3,Style: Earbuds
R2E8WJH3WQ07TL,B0BZTCXG6T,4.0 out of 5 stars An affordable option that deliver good results on sound quality and functionality,Kevin,4,"Although I am not a power-user when it comes to wireless earbuds, I am picky when it comes to comfort, and most importantly, sound quality. For may years now I have used AirPods and AirPods Pro models. I have generally been very satisfied with them, with the latter being a little less comfortable for me than I would prefer, and sound quality of both being on the above average side. And as far as functionality, they have worked pretty much flawlessly for me.When I saw these Panasonic ErgoFit earbuds, they seemed to boast the features that I tend to look for ‚Äì good sound, Bluetooth connectivity, noise cancelling, a portable charging case ‚Äì and of course, good sound quality with good base.My overall impression of the Panasonic‚Äôs is on the good side of the spectrum. As far as sound quality, in my opinion, I have found them to be on par with my AirPod Pros, and better than my standard AirPods, but that should be expected given that the Panasonics seal in your ears just like the AirPod Pros do. I‚Äôve also found the noise cancelling and ambient sound modes to work very well. I would however give the edge to the Pros on ambient sound mode. The Panasonics have something of a white-noise in the background when using ambient sound mode, and it is noticeable when you are not playing music.On phone calls, I can hear very clearly, and based on my testing, callers can also hear me very clearly, so the microphones do a very good job on phone calls. I would say that they seem to pick up a little more ambient noise than my AirPods, and callers can hear more background noise when speaking to me. But overall, unless you are doing something noisy, they work fine.As far as fitment goes, I‚Äôve found these to be bulkier than my Airpods and AirPod Pros. I would also say they are just slightly less comfortable than the Pros as well. But, given the activities that I use ‚Äúear-sealing‚Äù earbuds for, like jogging, mowing the lawn and working outside, I find them to be more than comfortable enough. Comfort is very subjective, so these may or may not be a good option for you.As to overall build quality, the Panasonic earbuds themselves feel solid and well made. The case on the other hand has something of an empty feeling to it, unlike the Apple cases which feel sturdy and well made. But regardless, the case works just fine, which ultimately is what matters.I have noticed that the Bluetooth connection with the Panasonics is not as resilient as it is with either pair my AirPods. In an open and unobstructed environment, the reliability of the connection, and the range of the connection is perfectly fine. However, if you introduce obstructions and if you change the orientation of your body, you will start losing the connection. If you keep your phone on your person this should not be a problem, but I like to place my phone down somewhere safe while I am mowing or if I am working on projects outdoors, and I have been annoyed by the tendency of the connection to drop more often than the AirPods do.So overall, what do I think about the Panasonic ErgoFit earbuds? Well, I like that you can get good sound quality while listening or speaking - and out of earbuds for under $100 dollars as not everyone has the money to purchase more expensive options. While the Panasonics lack some of the refinement of more expensive units, they put out good sound and offer the convenience of a portable charging case like their more expensive cousins. For working out, working outdoors, or just working around the house while jamming some tunes, I see these as an affordable option that shouldn't disappoint you, particularly as these are a value item in my opinion. I do feel like they could do a little bit better on the price though - $80 seems like an attractive figure, and the lower the cost gets under that $100 price point, the more attractive these Panasonics become.","Reviewed in the United States May 19, 2023",AENI5LOLYRFOHEFFXIF52VVR7CSQ,FALSE,1,Style: Earbuds with Noise Cancelling

There are better choices out there at this or lower price points.Pros- Small, pocketable case- Good build quality. Solid Panasonic reputation.- Very comfortable ""Ergofit""- Minimal in-ear adjustment required after insertion. They stay in place pretty well for non-winged earbuds, but do require infrequent adjustments in my wonky ears.- Sound quality is very good, even without EQing. Balanced. Good ""XBS"" bass, good treble. Compared to Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro, they rate 8/10 on sound.Cons- No wireless charging- A little awkward to get in and out of the case- No app support, which means no firmware updates to potentially improve them over time.- No app means no control customization.- No app means no EQ unless you use a 3rd-part EQ app like Wavelet, XEQ, or your music player's built-in EQ.- Cannot control volume from the earbuds, aside from summoning the digital assistant and asking it to turn the volume down. Cumbersome. Faster to just do it on your phone.- Controls are just OK. Sometimes you have to tap more than once to get them to register. And they seemed to respond more when I tapped below the visible sensor area than on it, but that's probably something I could adjust to in time.- ANC - The noise cancelling is just OK. It does work, and there is a marked difference between Off, Transparent Mode, and Noise Cancelling Mode. But it is not nearly as good as the Pixel Buds Pro, Liberty 3 Pro, or Earfun Free Pro 2.- Bluetooth connection stability. They have Bluetooth 5.3, as does my Pixel 7 phone. Despite un-pairing and re-pairing several times with my phone, they would frequently lose pairing, then re-pair. Sometimes they would not re-pair or re-connect without putting them back in the case and pulling them back out. During playback, they would have several very short interruptions or glitches per song. Very quick, like a record skipping, but still quite noticeable and aggravating. Sometimes when grasping the stem to adjust their fit in my ear, they lose connection and say ""pairing"". If buds can't stay connected, they are useless. I don't have these problems with other buds.- As is true with most buds, if they lose seal the sound quality degrades a lot. No bass, shrill treble, and no ANC because of outside sound leakage. You have to adjust them to get the seal and the bass back. But there's a 50/50 chance they'll lose connection when you grasp the stem to adjust.- Phone voice quality is just OK. The clarity is fine, but the volume is quiet. Callers have a hard time hearing me unless I speak quite loudly.I don't feel these buds are worth $100. They have a solid Panasonic brand name & build quality, but they offer too little for the money. A $50-65 price point is more realistic for these buds.Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro list for $169 but are frequently discounted to $129 or even $99.Earfun Free Pro 2 or Air Pro 3 are less than $99.Pixel Buds Pro list for $199 but are often on sale for $149.I would choose any of those over these Panasonics.","Reviewed in the United States May 12, 2023",AHO6IVLXFOSTQ3IH3LQPY7SUUWHA,FALSE,2,Style: Earbuds with Noise Cancelling

And there are cheaper options that offer these features.The connection range is not good if I'm being honest. Infact it may be the worst of any earbuds I've tried. If I leave out of the room the sound immediately starts getting choppy and eventually disconnects. And the rooms in my house aren't large. Also, sometimes it will randomly disconnect then reconnect even though I'm right in front of my phone. I'm not sure why this happens.The mic quality is good. I haven't had any issues while on calls. Overall it's a decent pair of earbuds. I would however consider some other options before getting these.","Reviewed in the United States May 29, 2023",AHZF5UHEQAKR3HY5WW42GBFJDSWQ,FALSE,1,Style: Earbuds with Noise Cancelling
R3CIKZN032N9RJ,B0BZTCXG6T,"3.0 out of 5 stars Low on volume, awkward controls, but alright earbuds.",opal,3,"I have a different set of earbuds that I'm pretty happy with, but they keep falling out of my ears and the shape gets uncomfortable after an hour or so of use, so I wanted to try this style out. Since Panasonic is a brand I grew up around, I had high hopes for these earbuds.These paired easily with my phone, and they're comfortable on my ears for their whole two and a half hour battery life.These earbuds are a pain to get out of the case, even with my small hands and somewhat long nails.The controls are AWFUL. They're difficult to master, rarely react the same way twice except to pause when I'm trying to skip, I cannot skip songs nor activate the ANC, and there's very little about the controls in the instruction booklet aside from a leaflet with mostly pictures- the other booklet is a European warranty that lacks a language that I can understand. I have no clue what the picture means for how to activate the ANC, so I gave up on that front. I can just barely get these to answer calls, so I don't bother. I use my phone's controls over the ones on these earbuds, they're so difficult to work with.I have to turn off my phone's bluetooth to disengage these earbuds from it.The volume on these is not stellar- at their max, I'm just barely satisfied with the volume, even when using VLC. Sometimes I want louder music to drown out construction work and the industrial-level banging at the nearby oil well- these cannot do that.However I do find that the sound is overall reasonably balanced, and the strength of the bass is adequate- but not great. The highs and mids are so-so: nothing to complain about, but the mids get muddy in certain ranges, and the highs are a tad too sharp at certain tones. I think that these are fine for casual use, but could be lacking for audiophiles.I can definitely say that I've used worse, but there's better earbuds out there.For a pair of earbuds from a such a well-known brand, these miss the mark. However for a pair of earbuds that let me listen to background music comfortably, these do the job fairly.Panasonic ErgoFit True Wireless Earbuds, Bluetooth 5.3 in Ear Headphones with XBS Powerful Bass, Charging Case ‚Äì RZ-B110W","Reviewed in the United States May 22, 2023",AE6MOP6PRWQNYAMN6EOFJDNRY5KA,FALSE,0,Style: Earbuds

BUT one died after little use.,Joseph Melcher,3,"Update of July 13, 2023: Despite my really positive review below, after only a few uses, one day, one of the buds simply stopped functioning. They are fully charged and no amount of fiddling has enabled me to get it working again. The one pairs automatically; the other just stays silent.First of all, these are truly noise-canceling. When you activate this function, there is a slight, but notable reduction in the ambient noise. Most importantly, they have excellent sound quality, with the best bass response I've noted in testing several of these types of buds. It boomsThe mid-range and treble range are also well balanced. They handle nicely and the controls are quite intuitive. I've not had a chance to test their battery life because I never listen more than an hour or so and then they get topped off in their storage case, which I just recharge periodically.","Reviewed in the United States May 14, 2023",AF74DCGNFJWZ5OQEQNNNWUUZBBJQ,FALSE,0,Style: Earbuds with Noise Cancelling
R3MEV9Y61XJ2YB,B0BZTCXG6T,5.0 out of 5 stars Nice ear buds with great sound,Norman White,5,"After receiving the buds I tried to attach the correct sized rubber pieces on to them and WOW was that difficult. They came off without too much issue but getting the new ones on...very tough.They didn't come off easy enough to worry about them popping off during normal wear and use but easy enough that I wasn't worried about tearing them.Pairing them was smooth and they quickly pair and disconnect when taken out and put away.The case is a nice slick black case that fits in the pocket and carges the buds nicely. I only wish there were covers for the case like with the Apple ones so that I can attach them to my lanyard like I do the Apple ones.I use these mainly as my work ear buds while away from the desk and the sound is perfect, I can be heard from other parties loud and clear and the volume on the buds for me works.They feel like they are about to slip out of my ears some times but they don't so i think I'm just used to using the AirPods where they fit inside more. Either that or I need to actually move to a smaller silicone piece.Been using these for some time now and after the initial full charge I haven't had to charge the case yet. I'd say that I've been using them for at least 3 to 4 hours per week and it's been at least three or four weeks since I have charged the case.Overall I'd give them a good rating on almost every aspect. They do cancel out some of the noise but not all of it unless the volume is turned up all the way. They don't crack or hiss when listening to quiet conversations and the little bit that I tested them with music it sounds like they would be perfect listening to everything from Bach to Black Sabbath.Highly recomend.","Reviewed in the United States July 5, 2023",AFDSGC4L4UX5YZCAAVVGRLKTIQUA,FALSE,1,Style: Earbuds with Noise Cancelling
R15TAKRKWIOPWQ,B0BZTCXG6T,4.0 out of 5 stars Typical earbuds.,Denise,4,4 stars only because these are Panasonic brand and they fit really good. Sound is great but as with most lower end ear buds you have to turn your device up to about 80% volume to get the best sound. I have decided that over/on ear headphones are your best bet for good sound. I even tried a volume/equalizer booster to see if that affected the sound. It helped a little. Sound out of 10 to 12mm drivers just isn't that great especially if the earbuds are of the budget end of the spectrum.

Touch functions work, earbuds themselves do the job if you're not picky about audio quality (not super cheap quality but not high quality for sure). ANC creates a crackling sound when in use and doesn't work too well. Ambient mode does work okay. It seems really muffely, not really clear at all. If someone is talking to you WITH no sound playing, you'll be able to understand them somewhat okay. For me, I wouldn't use this function at all. Case and earbuds are made of hard plastic, does not feel premium in the slightest, if anything really cheap feeling.TLDR: Earbuds work, but are mediocre for the price.

The sound quality is really just OK and I don't think the noise cancelling feature works very well. I can still hear very well what's going on when I have these on listening to music. The sensors are very sensitive so you'll have to be careful with that. I also wish it displayed how much battery you have left on the case, that would be really helpful. I'm not sure if it's possible to link this to a laptop or computer. I was hoping to use bluetooth and connect it to my laptop but haven't been successful.
